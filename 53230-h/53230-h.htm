<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span><span class="letra2">T</span> cannot with truth be said that monumental
history is treated in our day with scanty regard.
Never, perhaps, were such permanent and forcible
memorials of the past as the Arch of Titus in Rome,
the <i>Pont du Gard</i> in the south of France, and the
<i>Porta Nigra</i> of Trèves, visited and gazed upon with
warmer interest or a deeper sense of their value.
We all feel the power that is exerted over us by the
ruins of great Castles and great Abbeys. And in
another way is this strong feeling of our times
very widely manifested. I refer to the restoration
of Cathedrals and Churches&mdash;not only in our own
country now for many years&mdash;but, more recently, in
France. This restorative work may not always
have been conducted with faultless taste or perfect
judgment, but (to say nothing of religious motives)
it testifies to a high appreciation of the importance
of history written in stone.</p>

<p>There is, however, what may be termed a minor
monumental history, which has not by any means<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi"></a>{vi}</span>
always received its due attention. Our country is
full of historic scenes, where the past is visibly recorded,
and where, a few years ago, it was more
visibly recorded than at present. Old states of
society, old modes of living, obsolete habits of the
people, are commemorated in many a small building
which attracts little notice from the ordinary passer
by. The lives of eminent persons, public events of
high significance, have left their mark in villages,
and market towns, and wayside places, where these
recollections ought to be cherished, and where, if
possible, the hand of the destroyer ought to be
arrested. It should be added that nearly all such
scenes and such fragments are pleasing in their
aspect and worthy of the artist’s pencil as well as of
the historian’s pen.</p>

<p>Under the influence of mixed feelings, made up
partly of delight in what remains of this kind, partly
of sorrowful regret for what is lost, I cannot hesitate
to recommend these drawings by Mr. Rimmer,
which he has illustrated by a running commentary.
I do not commit myself to all his conclusions, which
embrace a great multiplicity of subjects connected
with very various parts of our country. The
plan of the book is, of necessity, somewhat desultory;
but I think there is some advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii"></a>{vii}</span>
as certainly there is no fatigue, in rambling with
him irregularly from county to county, through
towns and hamlets, and using his eyes as we
travel. We cannot all literally see these places
ourselves; and if we were to see them, we might
easily, through the want of some guidance, fail to
observe their true character and expressive meaning.
It should be remembered, too, that large numbers
of such historic and picturesque buildings as Mr.
Rimmer here delineates have been destroyed, or are
in danger now of destruction. It is something if
drawings preserve for us in one sense what in
another sense (and a very melancholy one) is irreparably
lost. Such views, too, and such pages as
these, may help us to set a higher value on that
which survives. On the whole, it seems to me
evident that this book is a very useful contribution
to what I have termed minor monumental history.</p>

<p>I will exemplify what I mean, and what I understand
Mr. Rimmer to mean, by one or two independent
illustrations, that suggest themselves to my
memory; and if, in some degree, I appear to differ
from him as to the resources of this kind which are
afforded by different parts of the country, this only
shows that, with all his care and diligence, he has
not exhausted his subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii"></a>{viii}</span></p>

<p>Two illustrations shall be taken from the
northern counties: and the first shall be the town
of Kendal, which our author dismisses as containing
hardly any architectural reminiscences of the past.
To this I somewhat demur. Kendal, indeed, has no
ancient houses, but its ground-arrangement is very
singular; and this must be very ancient. It consists
almost entirely of one broad winding street a mile
in length, from which narrow lanes, which are not
properly streets, open to the right and left, each
being entered by a very small passage. Such
narrow passages could very easily have been
defended, in case of forays from the Scottish
border; and it might be conjectured that they
were planned with this danger in view. This
question, indeed, must be dismissed as a puzzle
nearly as great as that which is connected with the
origin of the Chester <i>Rows</i>. The point of historical
interest, for the sake of which Kendal is here
brought forward, is this,&mdash;that through this broad
winding street, where the ground rises and falls
very boldly, and where even now the houses are so
varied in character that on days of light and shade
they supply many good subjects for pictures, the
troops of Charles Edward marched or straggled in
1745, both on the way to Derby and on their return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix"></a>{ix}</span>
Through this circumstance, especially if we combine
it with stories current in the neighbourhood concerning
that time, this dull Westmorland street
acquires a new and lively interest.</p>

<p>A second example is supplied by village after
village in that wide-spread country of the dales
which lies south-east of Kendal. Through Airedale
and Ribblesdale, from Bradford to Lancaster, and
northward to some considerable distance, there
are a multitude of specimens of a curious kind of
doorway, which I do not recollect to have seen
elsewhere. These doorways generally consist of
two curves, more or less regular, and more or less
enriched with ornament, and with the initials of the
families of some now forgotten dalesmen: the dates
range from about 1630 to 1730: the earlier forms
are simpler than those which follow; and after
the later period they seem to cease suddenly.
However this provincialism of rural architecture is
to be explained, it is a social and artistic fact worthy
of being observed and permanently recorded.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Midland Counties, I will
again illustrate the subject by a couple of instances.
Mr. Rimmer most accurately notes that the ancient
Roman way of Watling Street passes along the
north-eastern frontier of Warwickshire: but beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x"></a>{x}</span>
this he does not make much use of a county which
is by no means poor in historical associations. One
place which would have given him excellent
materials for description and for drawing, and not
far from that part of this county, where, to quote
the old rhyme,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From Dover to Chestre goth Watlyn-Street,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">is the village of Polesworth. My attention was
especially called to its picturesque and suggestive
aspect, because I happened to visit the place just
when I was within reach of the opportunity of
inspecting some of the manuscripts of that prince of
archæologists, Sir William Dugdale. The historian
of Warwickshire remarks that “for Antiquitie and
venerable esteem,” the village of Polesworth “needs
not to give Precedence to any in the Countie;” and
indeed there is a charming impression of age and
quiet dignity in its remains of old walls, its remains
of old trees, its church, and its open common. Not
far off, on an eminence commanding a delightful
view, is Pooley Hall, the Lord of which “by
Reason of the Floods at some time, especially in
Winter, which hindered his Accesse to the Mother
Church,” obtained a license from Pope Urban IV.
to build a chapel within the precincts of his lordship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi"></a>{xi}</span>
And here, in the garden of this modest hall, is a
little chapel of comparatively late architecture, but
doubtless built on the site of the old one; and here,
full in view, on the level ground below, with the
village beyond, is the river, evidently liable to
floods. I give this scene merely as a specimen of
the wealth that our English counties contain for
the historian who is also an artist.</p>

<p>The other county of which I am thinking is
Bedfordshire. Of course Mr. Rimmer does not
fail to take notice of the town of Bedford, and its
neighbouring village of Elstow, and their still visible
associations with John Bunyan; but there still
remain some things to be added to those which he
has so well described. I fear it must be admitted
that the prison, in which the author of the <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i> spent those days and nights that have
enriched the world, was not on the bridge over the
Ouse, but in another part of Bedford. The jailor’s
door, by a most curious accident, survives, built into
the wall of a granary, and with quite enough of
character to deserve an engraving on descriptive
pages. As regards the village of Elstow, there is
abundant material of this kind in the isolated
church tower, containing the very bells in the
ringing of which Bunyan rejoiced and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii"></a>{xii}</span>
trembled; in the curious building, undoubtedly contemporary,
upon the green where he danced; and,
above all, I must mention what appears till recently
to have escaped attention. The “wicket-gate” of
the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> is commonly represented as
a garden-gate or a turnpike-gate; but really the
term denotes a small doorway, cut out of a large
door; and concealed behind a tree at the west end
of Elstow Church, is just such a small doorway
in the broad wooden surface of the great door.
Through this lowly opening Bunyan must often
have passed when a boy; and if it were simply
drawn and engraved, I believe we should have a
correct picture of that which was before his imagination
when he described the early steps of Christian’s
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>It is natural to both Mr. Rimmer and myself,
with such thoughts in our minds, that we should
make much of the ancient and striking city where
we happen to dwell. He begins with Chester: and
I will end with some words concerning it by a recent
American traveller. Those who come for the first
time from the United States to Europe frequently
hasten to Chester with a feeling of extraordinary
interest, partly because it is the nearest cathedral
city, partly because it is a walled city. This writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii"></a>{xiii}</span>
is describing the walls. “Chester has everywhere,”
he says, “a rugged outer parapet, and a broad hollow
flagging, wide enough for two strollers abreast.
Thus equipped, it wanders through its adventurous
circuit; now sloping, now bending, now broadening
into a terrace, now narrowing into an alley, now
swelling into an arch, now dipping into steps, now
passing some thorn-screened garden, and now
reminding you that it was once a more serious
matter than all this, by the occurrence of a rugged
ivy-smothered tower. Every few steps as you go
you see some little court or alley boring toward it
through the close-pressed houses. It is full of that
delightful element of the crooked, the accidental,
the unforeseen, which to American eyes, accustomed
to our eternal straight lines and right angles, is the
striking feature of European street scenery. An
American strolling in the Chester streets finds a
perfect feast of crookedness&mdash;of those random
corners, projections, and recesses, odd domestic
interspaces charmingly saved or lost, those innumerable
architectural surprises and caprices and
fantasies, which offer such a delicious holiday to a
vision nourished upon brown stone fronts.”</p>

<p>The pleasure which I feel in having anything to
do with a book like this is very much increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv"></a>{xiv}</span>
the reflection that American readers are likely to
take the warmest interest in the visible reminiscences
of history, in which the country that they recognise
as their mother-land still abounds.</p>

VARIOUS THEORIES OF THE ROWS&mdash;REMINISCENCES OF
ANCIENT HOUSES IN CHESTER&mdash;WIRRAL&mdash;CONGLETON&mdash;NANTWICH&mdash;WHITTINGTON.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span><span class="letra2">HERE</span> are not many Abbeys or Cathedrals
which have not been fairly delineated, and it is
a pleasure to add that in this respect few Parish
Churches have been neglected. Indeed, if these
possess any interest, they are almost sure to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>{2}</span>
a record of their form, and at least one antiquary
to publish their history. Ancient mansions also
have been lithographed by Habershon and Richardson,
and very excellently by Nash. Happily, also,
for this class of buildings, they generally belong to
some family who take a pride in them, and may
fairly be left to attend to their preservation.</p>

<p>It is not for such remains as any of the above
that a plea is needed; they have powerful friends,
and perhaps no enemies. But there is another
class of architecture that is fast fading away, and
that a class which has brightened many a landscape
and figured cheerfully in many a tale. Ruskin, in
his Oxford Lectures on Art, has said of the architecture
of old streets in towns and cities that “it is
passing away like a dream, without any serious
attempt having been made to preserve it, or indeed
even to delineate it.” Old blocks of buildings have
yielded to the modern innovator in numberless cases
where a little ingenuity and care would have adapted
them to their new requirements; and, as Ruskin has
eloquently said, “it is difficult to understand the
contempt and envy with which future generations
will look upon us who had such things and allowed
them to perish.”</p>

<p>Since commencing these pages, not less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>{3}</span>
three street scenes have been destroyed, which
would otherwise now figure among our illustrations.
One of them contained four houses that dated back
to the reign of Richard III., and these houses have
been destroyed, though in an admirable state of
solidity, and replaced by others that, as far even as
convenience is concerned, have little advantage, and
for every other consideration are not to be named
in comparison.</p>

<p>The wealth of England, however, in ancient
remains of all kinds is still very great, and nothing
illustrates this more strikingly than the fact that for
all the changes and improvements that go on in
ancient cities like Chester, Shrewsbury, or Salisbury,
we still find the antique character left, even
if several years have elapsed since our last visit.</p>

<p>The superior beauty of ancient street architecture
has already arrested the attention of many
landowners. Gabled cottages with tall chimneys,
in a style superior to that which has been often
called, not inappropriately, “Cockney Gothic,” are
built, and the problem of making small cheap dwellings
picturesque is gradually being solved, a
problem that was well understood by our forefathers.
This will be dwelt on at greater length
in the last chapter of the book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>{4}</span></p>

<p>Perhaps no more suitable starting-point than
Chester could be found for our researches. It is
tolerably well known to most Englishmen either
by description or personal inspection. The distinguishing
features of Chester are “The Rows” as
they are called. These are long covered arcades
of unknown origin and antiquity. In familiar
language, they resemble such a space as would be
formed by removing the storey over the ground
floor of a row of buildings through the entire length
of the street, and supporting the upper chambers
with columns or piers at irregular distances. They
differ entirely from those in Berne, or indeed anywhere
else, in their form and purpose, and also from
the covered passages outside the city, of which an
example is here given. These, indeed, resemble
similar structures at Berne, Totness, and other places.</p>

<p>Speaking of them, Colonel Egerton Leigh, one
of the members of Parliament for Cheshire, has well
remarked in a paper read before the Chester
Archæological Society: “I really think it would
improve the quaint look of the city if the projection
of the second floor, supported on pillars (either
of wood, brick, or stone) over the pavement, were,
under certain necessary regulations and restrictions,
encouraged on the Boughton, Hanbridge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>{5}</span></p>

<p>Northgate approaches to Chester. There are several
examples of this style remaining in the suburbs,
and they are a curious and characteristic introduction
to the Rows inside the city.” The illustration
is taken from the Boughton approach to Chester.
One peculiarity may be noticed: the nearest pier
of the arcade is enlarged into a kind of buttress
capacious enough to accommodate a barber with
his stock in trade; and this is not the only example
in the city, there are similar establishments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span>
Bridge Street, Watergate Street, Northgate Street,
and in the piers of the arcades.</p>

<p>According to Webb, the Rows were built as a
refuge to the citizens during any sudden attack of
the Welsh, though the mode of building in the more
northerly part of England would seem to have been
better adapted for any such emergency. However,
let Webb tell his own story: “And because these
conflicts continued a long time, it was needful for
them to build a space before the doors of their
upper buildings, upon which they might stand in
safety from the violence of their enemies’ horses,
and withal defend their houses from spoyl, and
stand with advantage to encounter their enemies
when they made incursions.” Pennant, on the
contrary, says: “These Rows appear to me to have
been the same with the ancient vestibules, and to
have been a form of building preserved from the
time the city was possessed by the Romans. They
were built before the doors, midway between the
streets and houses, and were the places where
dependents waited for the coming out of their
patrons, and under which they might walk away
the tedious minutes of expectation. Plautus, in
the third act of his <i>Mostella</i>, describes both their
station and use:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>{7}</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Viden vestibulum ante ædes et ambulacrum ejusmodi.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The shops beneath the Rows were the cryptæ and
apothecæ, magazines for the various necessaries of
the owners of the houses.”</p>

<p>Other writers, such as Stukely, confirm the
Roman origin of the Rows; but Lysons, certainly one
of the most accomplished and patient antiquaries of
England, dissents from the Roman theory. “Mr.
Pennant thinks,” he says, “that he discerns in these
Rows the form of the ancient vestibules attached to
the houses of the Romans who once possessed the
city. Many vestiges of their edifices have certainly
been discovered in Chester, but there seems to be
little resemblance between the Chester Rows and
the vestibules of the Romans, whose houses were
constructed only of one storey.” Hemingway, the
historian of Chester, seems to differ very much from
Lysons, and refers the Rows to the Roman period.
“Nor am I aware,” he says, “of any historic data
that can disprove an opinion I strongly entertain,
that the excavations mentioned, by which our Rows
as distinguished from the carriage-road are formed,
are the work of Roman hands.”</p>

<p>The end of a Row in Bridge Street here given
will easily illustrate the manner in which these
singular passages are broken, and resumed after<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>{8}</span></p>

<br />
<span class="caption">SCENE IN A CHESTER ROW.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">being intersected by a cross street. Hemingway in
another passage says, “It hardly requires a word of
argument to show that the pavements in Bridge
Street, Watergate Street, and Eastgate Street were
originally on a level with the houses standing in
the Rows; for it is utterly impossible to conceive
that the present sunken state of the streets, as
contrasted with the elevated ground on either side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>{9}</span>
could be the effect of natural causes. It is most
obvious, therefore, that at some period or other the
principal streets have been made to take their
present form by dint of human art and labour; and
it is not less evident that from the East, West, and
South Gates to the Cross, and from the latter to
nearly where the Exchange now stands, which is
almost the highest part of the city, excavation has
been employed. These conclusions, though they
are incapable of proof from any existing testimony,
seem necessarily to arise from a close observation of
the subject, and I believe they have received the
concurrence of all our historians and antiquaries.
But some difference of opinion has existed as to the
fact whether these excavations were made prior to
the erection of the buildings above, or subsequent
to them. This question, although involving no
important point of history, is worthy of a slight
notice, if it were for no other use than a curious
speculation. Webb, in <i>Kings Vale Royal</i>, fixes the
origin of the Rows at a much later period than the
one I am of opinion they were entitled to, and he
likewise leans to the hypothesis that they were a
kind of afterwork, begun and completed when the
buildings in the sunken line of the streets were
already inhabited.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span></p>

<p>Much has been written on the origin of the
Rows, and much learning has been expended on the
subject, which is indeed of exceptional interest, but
it is generally considered that only a little light has
been thrown upon it. Of course, at the present
time they are so varied in antiquity and form that
it is difficult indeed to approach the subject.</p>

<p>The curious Row in Watergate Street here
given is a very good example of the more ancient
forms. This particular building is generally called
Bishop Lloyd’s Palace, and the front of it to the
street, as all visitors to Chester will recollect, is
ornamented with grotesque wood carvings; but it
must be evident that it only occupies the site of
some more ancient building; indeed, the oldest of
the Rows is evidently in the same position, and we
must look for their origin in more remote forms.
All theories that refer them to some particular date
at which they were simultaneously constructed seem
to have been abandoned, and chance-medley has
probably had more to do with them than we at one
time fancied. An American gentleman of great
intelligence, who visited the city for the first time
during the progress of this work, may possibly have
conjectured something of the origin of the Rows by
giving the original builders credit for sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span></p>

<p class="nind">sagacity in their work. “Chester,” he said, “is far
beyond any city we possess in the New World in
point of convenience. Country towns are run up
there on a uniform plan, and in some of the streets
in the cities of the far west are great blocks of
pretentious warehouses and stores that look like<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span>
bankruptcy itself. A tradesman commencing business
has but little option&mdash;he must either take one of
these or else he is out of the world. And if he takes
a place that is so much too large for him, he has to
purchase more goods than he can pay for when the
time for payment comes round. I speak,” he said,
“of no imaginary evil, but one that actually exists, as
I have found out to my cost; but here, in the Rows,
are shops and stores of all sizes, so that a tradesman
commencing business may suit himself with premises
to his proper requirements, yet not be out of
the business world.” He further added that their
exceeding picturesqueness, the shelter they afforded
from summer heats and winter storms were too
obvious to even point out, and that such places in
America would have the vast advantage of affording
a dry footwalk over the snow, and protection from
the rays of an almost tropical sun; so that for
economy, beauty, and convenience, the Rows have
the advantage over all other modes of building for
ordinary city purposes. There is, perhaps, no great
strain of imagination required to give the original
builders of Chester credit for seeing some of the
advantages of Rows for commercial purposes, and
letting each building as it grew conform with its
neighbour. Rows have been stopped and built up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span></p>

<p class="nind">even in the present century, and in Lower Bridge
Street something nearly approaching one has lately
been formed. Again, it is very evident that some of
the Rows were not existing, at least in their present
position, in the thirteenth century, and they must
have been constructed since that time. Under all
circumstances, the simplest way out of the difficulty
would seem to be that the Rows were the result of
some prevalent fashion of building, more adventitious
than anything else. A Roman portico may have
suggested some form that was preserved in rebuilding,
or some few spirited proprietors may have
commenced the system without any combined action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span></p>

<p>Old Lamb Row, here shown, was a perfectly
independent Row by itself, and clearly only copied
from others. The house is said to have been the
residence of Randal Holme, who has left us some
valuable records of Chester, though it is clear that
the woodwork was of more ancient date, and must
have been adapted as the details on the recently
uncovered front in the same street which forms the
subject of another illustration. The date on this
is 1664, but it is very obvious that the carving
on the wood is much more ancient, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span>
the timbers were taken from some more antique
structure. The happy way in which municipal laws
were passed and carried, is illustrated by an incident
in the career of Lamb Row, for in 1670 the corporation
considered it a nuisance, and though no
Act of Parliament seems to have been infringed by
its erection, they said that the “nuisance erected by
Randal Holme in his new building in Bridge Street
be taken down, as it annoys his neighbours, and
hinders their prospect from their houses.” No
particular result would seem to have followed this
resolution of the council. Mr. Holme allowed it to
stand, though, as events proved, the city were right,
for in 1821 it fell down, owing to its bad construction
and some slight decay in the timbers. The
name Lamb Row was derived from the sign of
a lamb over a tavern, for which the building was
let after Mr. Holme’s death. It is a curious
illustration of the immunity of the times that
the Corporation fined Mr. Holme £3: 6: 8 the
following year for contempt against the mayor,
in disregarding their minute; which fine does
not seem to have met with a better fate than the
original order.</p>

<p>The street which cuts through the Row in
Bridge Street, and is part of a former illustration, is
called Commonhall Street, and it formerly contained
a very curious building, of uncertain origin, which
afterwards was converted into almshouses. It was
very massive and quaint, and it should have formed
one of our illustrations, but unhappily, almost without
notice to the citizens,
it was demolished,
to make room for an
unsightly row of brick
cottages, and, as far as
I have been able to
learn, no drawing of it
is preserved.</p>

before he was taken to be executed at Bolton, in
1657. “Mr. Bagaley, one of his gentlemen,
attended him at his dying hour, and thus speaks of
one Lieutenant Smith, a rude fellow, with his hat
on:&mdash;He told my lord he came from Colonel
Duckenfield, the governor, to tell his lordship he
must be ready for his journey to Bolton. My lord
replied, ‘When would have me to go.’ ‘To-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>{18}</span>

my lord, ‘commend me to the governor, and tell
him I shall be ready by that time.’ Then said
Smith, ‘Doth your lordship know any friend or
servant that would do the thing your lordship
knows of? It would do well if you had a friend.’
My lord replied, ‘What do you mean&mdash;to cut off

could have a friend.’ My lord said, ‘Nay, sir, if
those men that would have my head will not find
one to cut it off, let it stand where it is!’<span class="lftspc">”</span> The
carvings in the front of this house are extremely
beautiful.</p>

<p>The next engraving shows the tower in Chester
Castle called “Julius Cæsar’s Tower.” This castle
has been much modernised, but was a grand specimen
of a Norman residence even in Pennant’s time,
writing at the close of the last century. “On the
sides of the lower court stands the noble room
called <i>Hugh Lupus’</i> Hall. The length is nearly
99 feet, the breadth 45, the height very awful, and
worthy the state apartment of a great baron. The
roof supported by wood-work, in a bold style, carved,
and placed on the sides, resting on stout brackets.”
This building, now destroyed, probably retained its
original dimensions. The character of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a>{19}</span></p>

<p>Norman earl required a hall suited to the greatness
of his hospitality, which was confined to no bounds.
“He was,” says Ordericus, “not only liberal but
profuse; he did not carry a family with him, but an
army. He kept no account of receipts or disbursements.
He was perpetually wasting his estates,
and was much fonder of falconers and huntsmen
than of cultivators of land and holy men; and by
his gluttony he grew so excessively fat that he
could hardly crawl about.” Adjoining the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>{20}</span>
this great hall is the court of exchequer, or the
chancery of the county palatinate of Chester. The
account here given is, we will hope, an exceptional
one of the barons of the period.</p>

<p>The walls of Chester are entire, and a complete
circuit of the city may be made on them without
once leaving the footwalk on their summit. These
are the only complete walls in England, though at
one time all considerable towns were similarly surrounded.
The semicircular building shown here is
the lower part of a tower that was taken down, and
similar towers yet remain on the walls in a state of
great preservation.</p>

<p>Close by the tower here shown was an old
hostelry called the “Blue Posts,” kept by Mrs.
Mottershed in the year 1558. This was the year
when Queen Mary reigned; and one Dr. Henry
Cole, Dean of St. Paul’s, was charged by his royal
mistress with a commission to the council in Ireland,
which had for its object the persecution of
Irish Protestants.</p>

<p>“In this house,” says Hemingway, “he was
visited by the mayor, to whom, in the course of
conversation, he related his errand, in confirmation
of which he took from his cloak a leather box, exclaiming,
in a tone of exultation, ‘Here is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>{21}</span>
which will lash the heretics of Ireland.’ This
annunciation was caught by the landlady, who had
a brother in Dublin, and while the commissioner
was escorting his worship (who that year was Sir
Lawrence Smith) down stairs, the good woman,
prompted by an affectionate regard for the safety
of her brother, opened the box, took out the commission,
and placed in lieu of it a pack of cards with
the knave of clubs uppermost. This the doctor
carefully packed up, without suspecting the transformation,
nor was the deception discovered till his
arrival in the presence of the lord deputy and privy
council at the castle of Dublin. The surprise of
the whole assembly on opening the box containing
the supposed commission may be more easily
imagined than described. The doctor was sent
back immediately for a more satisfactory authority,
but before he could return to Ireland, Queen Mary
had breathed her last. The ingenuity and affectionate
zeal of the landlady were rewarded by
Elizabeth with a pension of forty pounds a year.”</p>

<p>The old front previously shown is in the same
street where the “Blue Posts” stood, and is a fine
example of a black-and-white gable. The carving
on the woodwork is more ancient than the date that
appears on the building, and has been cut and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>{22}</span>
adapted from some older house&mdash;not by any means
an uncommon case, though the cause of considerable
confusion to the antiquary if the adaptation has been
a good one. This is the house that has been alluded
to as being covered with plaster, and only brought
to light during the progress of the present work.
Indeed plans were prepared for a new building,
but the firm of architects who were employed,
as soon as they found that there was ancient
work under the plaster, properly cancelled their
plans, and adapted the old front to the requirements
of the proprietor. The curious house in
the same street, here shown, is probably among
the most ancient wooden structures in Chester:
there is nothing to indicate its exact age, but its
general appearance would point to considerable
antiquity; houses of this shape, however, were
common from the beginning of the fifteenth to the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Hemingway, speaking of Bridge Street, says,
“Every gradation of architecture, from the rude
clumsy wood hut to the open airy commodious hotel,
is here displayed, and it is not perhaps the least
worthy of observation to see the awkward confinement
of low close rooms gradually yielding to the
more healthful taste of modern building. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>{23}</span></p>

<p class="nind">original plan of the houses (if there was any plan
at all) seems to have been in the cottage style, with
the gable end of each to face the street. This mode
of building certainly gives great extent of premises
behind, but renders the inner rooms and staircase
rather dark.” He adds what is true of other streets
in the city beside Bridge Street, “The curious
observer will discover in the street that the square
brick fronts of some of the houses are nothing more
than a wall carried up as high as the ridge of the roof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>{24}</span>
thus having the appearance of a handsome modern
house, while the interior retains most of its original
formation.”</p>

<p>The next illustration is of a fine gabled house in
Whitefriars: this is remarkably well proportioned,
and has some very excellent work inside.</p>

<p>The outside of the Row in Eastgate Street,
behind which the “Dark Row,” previously alluded
to, runs, has unfortunately been pulled down since
this work was commenced, but the drawing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>{25}</span>
head of the chapter gives an accurate idea of the
premises, and was made just before the building
was demolished. It consisted of the three gables
shown, and some back premises, and its strength
was so great that some time was spent in its
destruction.</p>

<p>The most westerly part of Cheshire is called
Wirral, and it formerly was covered with forests,
though now it is nearly destitute of any considerable
woods. The land of which it is formed is rocky,
and contains some good veins of building stone.
In consequence of this there are a number of very
substantial stone houses in most of the villages.
Many of them are of good design, and well adapted
to modern requirements; simple, indeed, as this
style may seem, it is quite possible for the designer
to find himself in confusion in carrying it out. The
roofs and chimneys should be so contrived as to
stand out clearly, and to show that the house <i>has</i> a
roof and a chimney. The great danger of this style
is that, if employed by inartistic hands, it is apt to
become tame, or else to develope itself into some
kind of Swiss cottage that hardly suits an English
landscape.</p>

<p>The ancient house at Bidston village, here
given, was at one time the residence of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>{26}</span>
Derby family. The Earl, who was executed at
Bolton, and whose tragic end has been alluded to,
lived at Bidston Hall, now a picturesque and
substantial farm-house.</p>

<p>At Tranmere village, on the Cheshire side of
the river Mersey, is an exterior well known to all
Liverpool pedestrians. There are some curious
panes of glass in it, with emblematic devices and
legends on them, and the stonework is excellently
true.</p>

<p>The greater part, however, of the Wirral houses
have been sadly mutilated, owing to the proximity
of that part of Cheshire to Liverpool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>{27}</span></p>

<p>Congleton, in the eastern part of Cheshire, is a
fine example of an old English country town that
has been built at various times, but has always
retained its antique character. It is situated in
a lovely country, through which the river Dane
quietly flows to the Weaver, and it is hemmed in on
all sides with venerable family seats. The buildings
tell their own tale in very permanent materials.
There are red brick houses of a century and a half
old, and joining these are gabled ones of greater age.
The roofs are of different levels, and covered,
according to the period of their erection, with slates
or tiles or flags. Here and there a black and white
house is left, and there are in some streets a few
cottages built into the motley row; some of these
are of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The old Inn at Congleton is a fine specimen of
a black-and-white gabled hostelry. The great
porch, with a room over, rests on two stone pillars,
and the interior of the Inn quite corresponds in
character with the exterior. This is just the kind
of Inn so dear to novelists, and so seldom well
described. Perhaps the country Inn in <i>Barnaby
Rudge</i> is as well-drawn a picture of one of the old
houses of accommodation as any; and if Dickens’
works are ever to be picturesquely illustrated, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a>{28}</span>
Lion Inn at Congleton might serve the artist for a
model. All it wants to complete its ancient character
is the signboard across the road.</p>

<p>Cheshire abounds with material for such a work
as this; and many old towns&mdash;Sandbach, Malpas,
Nantwich, or Knutsford, for example&mdash;are well
worthy of a visit. A curious old house at
Nantwich is here given; the bow window consists
of a heavy octagonal bow overhanging another
of similar shape and smaller dimensions in a
kind of telescope fashion. The noble octagonal
church tower is rising above. Nantwich church
is seen to great advantage from many parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a>{29}</span>
the town, and is of Cathedral dimensions. It is
remarkably beautiful in details, and is in a fine
state of preservation.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">NANTWICH.</span>
</div>

<p>There are many houses in Nantwich with dates
of the sixteenth century carved on them, and there
is a curious history belonging to them. In 1583 a
great fire swept away nearly the whole of Nantwich,
and immediately after a collection was instituted to
reimburse the inhabitants for their heavy losses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>{30}</span>
The parish register says, “A most terrible and
vehement fire, beginning at the water-lode, about
six of the clocke by night, in a kitchen, by brewinge.
The winde being very boisterouse increased the said
fire, which more vehementlie burned, and consumed
in the space of 15 hours, 600 bayes of buildings,
and could not be stayed neither by labour nor
pollice, which I thought good to commend unto
posteritie, as a favourable interposition of the
Almightie, in destroying the buildings and goods
only, but sparing the lives of many people, which,
considering the time, space, and perill, were in great
jopardie.”</p>

<p>The term “600 bayes” is a suggestive expression,
and it probably has a similar meaning to bay of
modern times. This is generally understood to
denote the space between the principals of a roof,
the sections as it were into which the front to the
street was cut. The building here illustrated would
thus have five bays; but the expression seems to
have been customary in Queen Elizabeth’s time to
define the size of a house. The clown says in
“Measure for Measure,” “If this law hold in Vienna
ten years, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after
threepence a bay.”</p>

<p>The collection was ordered by the Queen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>{31}</span>
1585, and perhaps partook rather of the character
of a rate. The estimated damage was £30,000, an
enormous sum in those days.</p>

<p>Ellesmere is situated in the northern extremity
of Shropshire, nearly at its contact with Cheshire.
It is on a fine sheet of water, from which it takes its
name. The streets are remarkably picturesque.
There are many substantial residences in it, which
are finely shaded with forest trees and evergreens,
and at one end of the town is a large ancient
cruciform church overlooking the lake. The woods
and lawns of Oakley Park stretch along the opposite
shore, and it would be difficult to imagine a more
delightful scene. Long low comfortable hotels with
bow windows prevail in Ellesmere, and they have
ample accommodation for coaches and post-horses,
though now grass grows in many of the roomy
quadrangles round which their stables are built, as
most of their occupation is gone.</p>

<p>I noticed a pleasing device on the front of one
of the houses which faced the south: a large
grape vine grew at one end of the house, and it was
bent horizontally after reaching a certain height
across the whole front of the building; over it was
an open verandah roofed with thick glass, which
enabled the grapes to ripen, and formed a charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>{32}</span>
summer shade; indeed, on the bleakest winter day,
Ellesmere has a sunny cheerful look. The road
from Ellesmere to Oswestry lies through a beautiful
country, and is about eight miles long. The Green
Man, so called from the sign of a forester in
hunting green, is another example of an old-fashioned
roadside Inn. The walls are panelled
in oak, and the ancient benches and tables with
carved legs still remain. The fireplace in the hall
is 12 feet wide, and ornamented with a great store
of antique pewter platters. Halston Park, a little
farther along the Oswestry road, was the seat
of the celebrated Captain Mytton, whose random
exploits are the subject of a rather uncommon
biography.</p>

<p>Whittington village lies on the same road, and
is about two miles from Oswestry. It is introduced
here to illustrate the excellent effect of breadth in a
landscape. A well-defined broad white gable stands
out against the rest of the village and sets it off.
Of course there is the advantage of fine trees behind
it, but it stands back from the road, which is broader
here, and affords them every chance of being seen.
It is actually a fact, which few persons unacquainted
with perspective would at first credit, that if the
road continued at the same width, and if ordinary
three-storied village houses were substituted, this
beautiful scene would be completely closed out.
We pass in English roads hundreds of pleasant
prospects that we do not know of, as they are shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>{34}</span>
out by the dreary brick buildings that characterise
the present century.</p>

<p>A comparatively small object may do an
immense amount of mischief. We may, for example,
be admirably placed in a theatre for seeing
and hearing everything. The building may be
crowded, but we see over a low-sized individual in
front the whole of the scenery and the performers,
when a hat, only six inches high, and about as
broad, appears, and then “our revels all are ended,”
and the actors have “melted into air&mdash;into thin
air.”</p>

<p>This kind of teaching is especially wanted now
among architects. It is not too much to say of the
majority of them, that if they were required to build
a church in some distant county, they would consider
it quite sufficient to have a plan of the churchyard
and adjoining lanes sent to them, without their
having the least idea of the surrounding buildings or
trees, or the outline of the neighbouring hills.
Infinite pains are taken with details, but though
books which treat of these are excellent and numerous,
one turns in vain for any architectural work to
guide him to a knowledge of what is more important&mdash;picturesqueness.
Ruskin’s works are not as yet
studied by architects as they should be; indeed they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>{35}</span>
require a previous knowledge of, at any rate, the
preliminary elements of art, which, to some extent,
would limit their general acceptance in the profession.
Still the number of his readers is increasing
yearly among architects, much to the advantage of
the country. Detail, however beautiful, and however
necessary excellence in it may be, can no more
improve a building that jars with its surroundings,
than an elaborate label can cure a bottle of
indifferent Rhenish wine.</p>

<p>There is a curious old book written by Sir
Edward Moore to his son and heir, which shows
how a landlord of the seventeenth century regarded
the appearance of his street property. He was the
principal lord of the manor of Liverpool, and at
great length gives directions for the guidance of his
heir. Speaking of one of the tenants, he says:&mdash;“This
man should have built two dormer-windows,
as the others did, but when he had got me
fast, and he was loose, he would build none, but
made the house like a barn, much to the disparagement
of the street. If he have occasion to use you,
deal not with him till he hath made two dormer
windows.” Instances are unhappily the exception
where such fastidious care is taken of the appearance
of a street by the proprietor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>{36}</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span><span class="letra2">SWESTRY</span> is an exceedingly interesting old
town, and was at one time walled; portions of
the wall still remain, and there are also a number of
half-timbered and stone houses of very considerable
antiquity.</p>

<p>One example only is given here; it is an old
stone house which has been used for many generations
as an Inn, and is said to have been originally
built for that purpose. It is situated near the
ancient parish church, adjoining the churchyard.</p>

<p>The road from Oswestry to Shrewsbury is
through an interesting country, abounding with
many pleasing relics of antiquity. It was along this
road that the mighty, and as would now seem the
prudent Glendower, marched with his levies to assist
Hotspur at the battle of Shrewsbury, and an oak at
Shelton is still preserved where his march terminated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>{38}</span>
and which he ascended to witness the engagement.
Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, is
generally visited by tourists to Wales, either at the
commencement or the end of the journey. In some
respects it is more striking than Chester, and at first
sight it gives a more vivid picture of a fine old
English town. Chester, it is true, has more hidden
treasures concealed often under modern exteriors;
indeed the oldest inhabitant is probably ignorant of
all the ancient relics this city contains.</p>

<p>Shrewsbury is delightfully situated on a peninsula
formed by a bend of the Severn, and occupies two
gently rising hills. It was always an important
stronghold in the civil wars, and its name continually
occurs in the pages of English history. The old
timbered house here shown dates back to the fifteenth
century, and was probably the town residence of the
Abbot of Lilleshall, who appears to have figured in
the unhappily futile negotiations between Henry IV.
and Hotspur, which preceded the battle of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Shakespeare vividly brings us back to the hot
July day when, by forced marches, Henry reached
Shrewsbury only a few hours before Hotspur. The
king burned down the houses on the Hodnel road
to prevent their being a refuge for the forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>{39}</span></p>

<p>Hotspur, and all that now stand are built at a more
recent date than the battle of Shrewsbury. The
street here shown is among the most perfect
examples of ancient English streets yet remaining;
perhaps it is the most perfect. It takes a sudden
turn at right angles in the middle, and joins a street
running in a different direction, the High Street as
it is called. The houses in this remarkable street<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>{40}</span>
are high, and in excellent preservation, though most
of the carved work of the interiors has been removed.
The curious projecting gable
here shown is an example of
many other similar ones in
the vicinity. For a considerable
distance a person walking
down the middle of the street
can touch the houses on either
side. We only notice such
singular economy of room in
walled cities and towns, for,
as has before been remarked,
the liberality of space in villages
contributes greatly to
their beauty. Each end of
this street, which is called Double Butcher Row, is
here given.</p>

<p>The spire on the left of the picture is St. Mary’s,

church was originally built by a daughter of King
Alfred’s. The carving on the exterior of the houses
in this street is as perfect as it was when originally
placed in its present position. The entrance from

<p>Henry IV. reached Shrewsbury a few hours
before Hotspur on the 19th of July 1403, and
burned down the houses on the road as before
said. This road was rebuilt shortly after, and many
of the houses are still standing which date back
to that period: a block of them is here shown. The
Haughmond hills rise clearly and sharply above
them, and are wooded up to the summits. When
the sun rises red over them, and especially if this
is accompanied with a noise of wind, it is a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>{42}</span>

Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Another circumstance may be noticed here,
though it hardly belongs to the present work, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>{43}</span>
illustrates the ready way in which Shakespeare took
advantage of any incidents that met his eye. In
the fruitless interview between Earl Worcester and
the King, the former says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Worcester.</i> Hear me, my liege;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mine own part I could be well content,<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Prince Henry.</i> Peace, chewet, peace.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It has been supposed by Pope and others, that
this should read “peace, <i>chevet</i>, peace.” Chevet
being the French for a pillow, and this they supposed
alluded to Falstaff’s corpulence. But in an edition
published by Longman and others in 1757 good
reasons are given for adopting the reading chewet&mdash;the
common green plover or lapwing. This bird, it is
hardly necessary to say, has a habit, when its young
are hatched, of suddenly appearing before any one,
and uttering a sharp cry. The prince has only
bantered Falstaff good-naturedly the moment he is
summoned to join the king, and reproves his interruption
in this way. It is not noticed in the
edition referred to, but it is worthy of remark that
the meadow lands leading from Shrewsbury to
Battlefield literally swarm with these birds. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>{44}</span>
improbable that the humour of Falstaff’s statement
to Henry, “We rose both at an instant and fought a
long hour by Shrewsbury clock,” may lie in the fact
that the clock of St. Mary’s Church, the one alluded
to, has only a single face, and that is turned to the
town, having its back to the battlefield. This clock
was erected shortly before Shakespeare wrote the
play. The noble church of St. Mary contains a
tomb of the Leybourne family, to whom the unfortunate
Worcester was related. “Bear Worcester
to the death, and Vernon too,” and they were both
executed at the high cross immediately after the
battle. Now the tomb (published in <i>Architectural
Drawing Studies</i> by Dean Howson and myself) is
about fifty years older, from its style than the battle,
and in opening it some years ago a headless body
was found over the original stone coffin, wrapped in
leather, and apparently hastily interred, which in all
probability was the unfortunate Earl’s.</p>

<p>The last house to be illustrated in Shrewsbury
is the one at Wyle Cop, of which a sketch is given.
There is nothing to indicate its exact date, but it
must be of considerable antiquity, as the Earl of
Richmond, afterwards Henry VII., slept here on his
road to Bosworth field.</p>

<p>Shrewsbury is full of exceedingly interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>{45}</span>
remains, and in no town in England are they more
scrupulously taken care of. It is almost a matter
of regret that the scope of the present work forbids
a more detailed account of the Shakespearean recollections
of Shrewsbury battlefield, and the church
which was erected in memory of the day. There is
a fine old window with a representation of Henry
IV. in armour, and his face has a singularly sad,
majestic look. It was about 150 years old when
Shakespeare saw it, and it is not impossible that it
might have suggested the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>Indeed to many persons an excursion to the battlefield
of Shrewsbury, with a copy of “Henry IV.” in
hand, possesses attractions that equal a visit to
Waterloo. Prince Henry’s figure in the same
window as the king’s is rather disappointing. He
seems to be a tall youth, very fair, and somewhat
juvenile in his countenance.</p>

<p>Much Wenlock is a charming country town in
Shropshire, about twelve miles to the south-east of
Shrewsbury; the road to it lies through smiling
lanes, and past comfortable homesteads. It was
with sincere pleasure that I saw in this part of the
country old-fashioned farm-houses that had not kept
pace with the requirements of the age, but which,
instead of being pulled down and replaced by raw
new ones, were tastefully enlarged, and all the
creepers and ivy left standing. With a very little
taste and ingenuity this may be done, indeed
economically, and the exterior weather-stained walls
may be preserved to the landscape and the country.
Some of the great landowners in the northern and
midland counties are seeing the advantage of this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a>{47}</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_047_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_047_sml.jpg" width="239" height="288" alt="Image unavailable: ECCLESTON." /></a>
<br />
<span class="caption">ECCLESTON.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">and not a few farm-houses have been altered so as
to be pleasant objects to behold. Bitterley in
Shropshire is a notable instance of this, as also is
Aldford in Cheshire, and Eccleston in the same
county. Eccleston and Aldford belong to the Duke
of Westminster, and there is no doubt that their
present owner is keenly alive to the charms of an
English landscape. One instance of this transformation
is here given&mdash;the school-house at Eccleston,
which, to a passer-by, would be taken for an ancient
house: the window with its evergreen is old, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>{48}</span>
gable over it and the chimneys are modern.
Excellently well they harmonise with the surroundings,
and fill a corner of the beautiful village. And
here a word may be introduced about “shams,” as
they are called in architecture, regarding which
there is much misapprehension. The “sham,” pure
and simple, is contemptible; such is a manufactured
ruin of an abbey or castle, or woodwork painted to
represent another material, and intended to convey
a wrong impression to a spectator; but where black-and-white
gables and walls fit in upon old work, and
dark coloured stone chimneys of antique shape look
like parts of the original structure, it is a happy
circumstance. Indeed I should go much further in
this direction, and say that if, as often happens, new
stones have to be inserted in old carved façades,
richly coloured by age, the effect is not pleasant
when the contrast is great. In such cases it would
be better to give the new stone a tint to tone it into
harmony. The generation who put it into the
building will have passed away before its patchy
appearance will have gone; and why should they be
condemned to look upon a harlequin front, when, by
overcoming a little prejudice, it might be prevented?
This prejudice, it is true, rose from a proper
principle, and was a proper protest against the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>{49}</span>
of shams and affectation. Hardly more than two
generations ago art was at the lowest ebb, and the
chances seemed strongly against its ever reviving.
Everything was fantastic and false; a gentleman had
his portrait taken as Apollo, and a lady as Ceres or
Diana; while the veriest country yokels who
could not read, no, nor their children after them,
were alluded to with the utmost effrontery by the
Georgian poets as Phyllises and Corydons playing
on lutes to sheep, or occupying their working-hours
in some other useful occupation, and spending their
leisure moments in composing iambics to their
damsels.</p>

<p>It is with positive shame we turn back to such
recollections, and half our indignation against the
churchwardens of the period, who destroyed so
much beauty, vanishes when we consider they only
did as their betters; indeed, rich as our island yet is
in architectural remains, I believe that since the
accession of George III. an almost equal amount to
that which remains has been destroyed.</p>

<p>But to return to Wenlock from this somewhat
lengthy digression, there are remains of a magnificent
abbey there founded by the Black monks, and
exhibiting several styles of architecture, especially
the Early English; and there are mouldings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>{50}</span>
details of great beauty, but in comparatively recent
days, much of this building has been carted away
and used up for repairs and outbuildings to farm-houses.</p>

<span class="caption">LODGE TO MUCH WENLOCK ABBEY.</span>
</div>

<p>The charming remain here represented appears
to have been an entrance to some part of the abbey
buildings, which, according to Dugdale, enclosed
a liberty of thirty acres; but the remains are
numerous in all directions, and unfortunately we
find too many of the carved stones built up in
stables and styes, having been removed by the
Corydons that formed the subjects of so many
pastoral poems of the Georgian age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>{51}</span></p>

<br />
<span class="caption">MARKET PLACE, WENLOCK.</span>
</div>

<p>The market-hall of Wenlock is the black-and-white
covered space shown, and over it are the
rooms connected with the business of the town and
surrounding district. This market is in an excellent
state of preservation, and is resorted to by the
country people in great numbers weekly. Shropshire
formerly abounded with these country market
halls; but now their numbers are diminished considerably.
An opportunity was afforded me when
in Wenlock of seeing the demolition of a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a>{52}</span>
very ancient houses near the market. Some of the
great chimney stacks were so exceedingly strong
that they seemed almost to defy the picks of the
workmen; the mortar, which was wanting neither in
lime nor in quantity, had set so hard that the last
chimney stack stood up alone, perfectly upright,
after at least half of its base had been destroyed.
The inhabitants told me that it was always considered
to be one of the oldest buildings in Wenlock,
but the exterior was entirely destroyed when I
visited the town. The old house which is introduced
as probably forming part of the abbey,
seems to have been a kind of gatehouse to some
part of the premises; it is apparently about 450
years old, and is in a perfect state of preservation.
Some of the inhabitants appear to be very proud of
it, and so we may fain hope that its days may be
long in the land. The last sketch of Wenlock
represents an old half-timbered house with a bold
bow window; some of the lights have been plastered
up, as is apparent from the sketch, but they could
readily be opened. This house has recently been
purchased, and is to come down. Perhaps it is as
much to this circumstance as any other that it has
found a place in these pages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>{53}</span></p>

<p>Shiffnal is another fine old town in Shropshire,
situated on the London road. It fairly brings back
the old coaching days to our memory. The inns
have an unusually hospitable look, and the unoccupied
stabling is enormous. The comfortable
window seats, the bow windows, and great bar
parlours have refreshed many a Tony Weller and his
“insides.” It is a little singular that a veritable
mail-coach carrying her Majesty’s mails does yet ply<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>{54}</span>
in these parts; a stranger at Bridgenorth is perhaps
astonished at seeing a coach and four galloping over
the Severn bridge, and wakening the old gabled
houses with its horn; and this is no amateur affair,
but it has plied from time immemorial from that
town to Wolverhampton. The railroad connection
which lies through Shiffnal is very circuitous, and
they say that time is saved in going by the mail-coach.</p>

<p>There are more town residences in a complete
state in Shropshire than in Cheshire, though in
Chester a number are covered up with new fronts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a>{55}</span>
At one time indeed nearly all the great county
families of Cheshire had residences in Chester.
The Stanley Palace is still standing where the
Earl of Derby was arrested and sent to execution
at Bolton by the orders of Cromwell, and on
each side of Watergate Street, where this palace
is situated, are the remains of ancient city mansions.
The tendency of families to migrate
to the county town instead of London in the
“season,” was partly owing to the difficulty of the
roads (for nothing now in England can give an idea
of the undertaking of a journey of 200 miles to
London), and partly also to a singular law which
forbade as far as possible any country gentleman
who was not in parliament from residing in London.
D’Israeli, in the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, mentions
some remarkable features of the dread people entertained
of an overgrown metropolis. “Proclamations
warned and exhorted; but the very interference of
a royal prohibition seemed to render the metropolis
more charming;” though for all this, from Elizabeth
to Charles II., proclamations continually issued
against new erections.</p>

<p>James I. notices “those swarms of gentry, who,
through the instigation of their wives, did neglect
their country hospitality, and cumber the city, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>{56}</span>
general nuisance to the kingdom.” He once said,
“Gentlemen resident on their estates are like ships
in port&mdash;their value and magnitude are felt and
acknowledged; but when at a distance, as their size
seemed insignificant, so their worth and importance
were not duly estimated.” The England even of
the present century is changed out of all possible
knowledge; indeed those are yet living who can
look back with a smile at the solemn county balls,
which were almost as difficult of access, and as
jealously guarded, as a court presentation of these
days. The Grosvenors and Derbys even of a
century ago fought keenly for the mayoralty of a
country town.</p>

<p>Nor were good reasons wanting for eschewing
London. Only two centuries ago a Sussex squire,
Mr. Palmer, was fined in the sum of £1000 for
residing in London rather than on his own estate in
the country, and that even in face of the fact that
his country mansion had been burned within the
two years when his trial took place! We are told
that this sentence struck terror into the London
sojourners; and it was followed by a proclamation
for them to leave the city with their “wives and
families, and also widows.” And now we have no
difficulty in understanding why there are so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>{57}</span>
large mansions in small country towns. The habit
of making the best of a hard lot influenced the
gentry even long after it would have been safe to
have followed Mr. Palmer’s example; and so we
find up to the Hanoverian period large old-fashioned
houses in some small country towns, that look, as
Dickens says, as if they had lost their way in
infancy, and grown to their present proportions.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Fanshaw wrote a curious poem on
the subject of the proclamation for gentlemen to
reside on their own estates, of which four verses
may suffice as a sample:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>There are even of Queen Anne’s reign many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>{58}</span>
excellent specimens of town architecture in remote
villages of Cheshire and Shropshire. Mr. Norman
Shaw has brought this late classic architecture again
into deserved repute, and quite a new work might
be published of the details of them,&mdash;the well-considered
mouldings, the wreaths, and chimney-pieces.
Many of these houses were inhabited even in the
present century by courtly&mdash;perhaps somewhat
formal&mdash;gentlemen, and now they are turned into
boarding-schools or village tenements. Railways,
of course, have rapidly and completely changed the
scene. The old moralist in Thackeray laments the
change of times, when a man of quality used to
enter London, or return to his country house, in a
coach and pair, with outriders, and now his son
“slinks” from the station in a brougham. In
speaking of the change that came over the architecture
of England in the Elizabethan age, when
Italian forms superseded the indigenous ones, it
is not for a moment meant that the change was
for the better. There was an incessant craving
for foreign importation, which was a subject of
satire among the writers of those days.</p>

<p>Portia says, in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, when
speaking of her English suitor, “I think he bought
his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>{59}</span>
his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.”</p>

<p>No, the change to Italian architecture was not
for the better. It is true that picturesqueness was
not stamped out of the genius of England, and so a
number of the buildings that were put up until the
reign of George the Second were shapely and often
noble; indeed the classic style has a breadth about
it, no doubt, that makes it safe for modern architects
to deal with, especially in country houses. Of
course the formal rows of windows, if the house is a
very large one, are a serious matter to deal with, as
far as the plan is concerned. A satirist of the
French school complained that in the new Palace
at Versailles a large window, under pompous
architraves on the outside, had to light a footman’s
closet and a back staircase, a partition inside making
an awkward division between the two. Still a broad
classic front surrounded by elms has a stately
appearance; and perhaps in certain situations, like
the margin of a Westmoreland lake, might seem
peculiarly well adapted to the wants of the landscape.
Too often a Gothic house among trees, if of
recent erection, is a mass of confusion; the chimneys
and gables do not stand out clearly from each other,
and breadth is entirely lost; while the architect who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>{60}</span>
designed it might have safely trusted himself to an
Italian façade. A thoroughly fine front, like Compton
Wynyates, Hadden, or even Trevallyan Hall in
the charming vale of Gresford&mdash;where every part
tells, and stands out, and where, notwithstanding its
many angles, breadth is preserved&mdash;is perfection in
a British landscape. There are, of course, architects
of the present day who can design such a building,
but their name is not legion. Tudor architecture is
admirably adapted for cities and towns, and much
more easily handled in a street than among trees.
By Tudor is here meant the English domestic style
that prevailed in the sixteenth century, and this
term is now commonly applied to the architecture
of England after the fifteenth century. It is not
a correct term in any sense of the word, but I have
sought for another in vain that would be even remotely
intelligible to a general reader.</p>

<p>Could old English architecture be revived in its
purity and beauty, Italian importations could well
be spared. But even before the destruction of
monasteries it was on the wane, the careless indulgent
life of the monks of later date is shown in
all their works. The flat arched windows were
devoid of any great design, and the workmanship
was very bad. These were the days when grotesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>{61}</span>
groups (giving them a mild adjective) flourished
and were admired, thrusting out the angels and
grave apostles of the preceding centuries, and
slovenly work followed careless design. Often in a
building of various dates the tall light shafts of the
thirteenth century rise to vast heights, and are as
straight and truly worked as they were when first
cut, looking indeed like one tall stone of matchless
workmanship, while the masonry of the sixteenth
century, especially if late, has begun to show its
joints and to gape. Such conclusions continually
force themselves upon the architectural student who
looks below the surface for a cause.</p>

<p>Bridgenorth is situated on the Severn, and is
extraordinarily picturesque. The town is planted
on a steep hill, and nearly every house in it is ancient.
There is an old covered market where the country
people congregate on Saturdays; it is in fact an
enlargement of the “Market Cross” of bygone days.
The lower part of this building is of brick, and the
upper part is black and white; a new market has
recently been built, but the country people always
flock to the old one so long as there is standing
room in it. Bishop Percy’s house, here shown, was
formerly filled with excellent carved work, but now
it is used as a smithy and blacksmith’s shop; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>{62}</span>
front to the steep street is a fine specimen of black-and-white
work, and it is pleasing to be able to add,
it is highly prized by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>There are in Shropshire many other towns of
interest and beauty. Ludlow, with its “Feathers”
Inn, is well known. The “Feathers,” of course, is
in allusion to the Prince of Wales, and the name is
common in all of the Welsh border towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>{63}</span></p>

<p>There are also Cleobury Mortimer, Church
Stretton, and Bishop’s Castle; but all these have
been tolerably well represented, as far as their
architecture is concerned, by examples already
given. The domestic architecture of Hereford,
Gloucester, and Worcester, differs considerably from
that we have been considering, but it also contains
many examples of beauty and value.</p>

<p>The city of Hereford is delightfully situated on
the Wye, and though modern improvements have
destroyed many old features, of which the recollections
remain, there are a few specimens of antique
architecture. The Wye Bridge and its ancient gatehouses
were formerly among the most picturesque
objects in the kingdom. Of the history of Hereford
there is no necessity to speak at any length.
It is generally now admitted that it has few claims
to Roman origin; and, as Britton briefly says,
“When civil dissensions unhappily divided the land,
being a place of some importance, it was anxiously
contended for by the opposing factions, and was
often the scene of warfare. Gates, walls, bastion
towers, etc., were therefore erected for its defence;
and hostelries, chapels, and other edifices, were
constructed for the accommodation of those who
followed in the train of the successive occupants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>{64}</span>
the castle, or who visited the shrines of St.
Ethelbert and St. Thomas Cantelupe. Some of
these still remain, but variously mutilated and
defaced.”</p>

</div>

<p>The house here shown was part of the old
Butcher’s Row&mdash;in Britton’s time “a large and
irregular cluster of wooden buildings,” placed nearly
in the middle of the High Town. Formerly there
were a number of connected houses in this Row,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>{65}</span>
but they have been taken down, and the one represented
is the only one now left. “The window-frames,
doors, stairs, and floors, are all made of
thick, solid masses of timber, and seem destined to
last for ages: over one of the doors is a shield
charged with a boar’s head and three bulls’ heads,
having two winged bulls for supporters, and another
bull for a crest: thus caricaturing the imaginary
dignity of heraldry. On other parts are emblems of
the slaughter-house, such as axes, rings, and ropes.”
The outline of this building is exceedingly picturesque,
and it is evidently of the age of James I.
Close to this stood the old Town Hall, chiefly built
of timber, and resting on three rows of arches, nine
in each. But about twenty years ago this interesting
structure was pulled down. There were
apartments in it for the fourteen city guilds. John
Abel built this curious old relic in the reign of
James I., and the same man, who was originally of
humble parentage, built some powder and corn
mills when the city was besieged by the Scotch
army in 1645.</p>

<p>In “<i>Pipe Lane</i>” the small cottage used to stand
where Nell Gwynn was born. It was only recently
pulled down, and is described as a small four-roomed
tenement, hardly beyond the requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>{66}</span></p>

cottage the Blue Bell Inn stands, a hostelry now
going to ruin; but an extremely picturesque outhouse
opening on the Wye remains, and was
standing in Nell Gwynn’s time; an illustration of
this is given, and some parts of it are suggestive for
modern designers. The cottage where Nell Gwynn
was born might easily have been allowed to remain,
as it really stood in no thoroughfare, and so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>{67}</span>
birthplace of the founder of Chelsea Hospital might
have been saved to the nation.</p>

<p>The pleasant town of Ross is situated on the left
bank of the river Wye. The streets are narrow
and very steep, and there are many remains of old
half-timbered houses that give it very much the
appearance of some Rhenish town. But Ross owes
most of its celebrity to being the birthplace of John
Kyrle, the celebrated “Man of Ross,” who benefited
his native town and county out of a modest
estate of £500 per annum, and has been immortalised
by Pope and Coleridge.</p>

<p>The house he lived in is on the left of the
market-place, and is divided into a chemist’s shop and
a dwelling. “The floors and panellings of several
chambers are of oak; a quaint opening leads to a
narrow corridor, and into a small room, traditionally
said to be the bedroom, where he endured his first
and last (his only) illness, and where he died. It
looks upon his garden. That garden is now
divided like the house; one half of it has been
strangely metamorphosed, the other half has been
converted into a bowling-green; the surrounding
walls of both, however, contain flourishing vine and
pear trees.” The market-hall of Ross stands at the
head of the principal street on a steep eminence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>{68}</span>
and though it is much crumbled it is still in daily
use. From Ross to Monmouth the distance,
through a road of great beauty, is about sixteen
miles, but it is twice this measurement by water.
The celebrated Goodrich Court stands in this road,
where Sir Samuel Meyrick collected his armoury,
and in the area of the courtyard at Goodrich Castle
Wordsworth met with the little girl who figures in
his ballad of “We are Seven.”</p>

<p>Monmouth is situated at the junction of the
Monnow and Wye, and derives its name from the
former river, as being at the mouth of the Monnow,
and the bridge over the Monnow is remarkably
picturesque. It belongs to the style that prevailed
during the thirteenth century, and is extremely
valuable as an example of the architecture of that
period: it somewhat resembles some of the York<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a>{70}</span>
bars in detail, but probably was never a military
work. It was only built for the collection of tolls
on the traffic into the city, and corresponded with
the gatehouses at Hereford bridge, now unfortunately
destroyed.</p>

<p>Monmouth was the birthplace of Henry V., and
his statue adorns the front of the market-place, of
which a sketch is given here, though of course this
structure is of a more recent date than the reign of
Henry. All round the market-place the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a>{71}</span>
Monmouth caps were made that occasionally figure
in old writings. Fluellen, in “Henry V.,” says: “If
your Majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen
did good service in a garden where leeks did grow,
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps.”</p>

<p>Usk and Abergavenny are other ancient towns
in Monmouth that have declined in importance
during modern times, but they are very pleasant,
and there are still remains of their former splendours
in the streets.</p>

<p>Worcester is generally supposed to have been a
link in the chain of military defences of the eastern
bank of the Severn that extended from Uriconium
to Gloucester, and as early as the year 680 it was
surrounded by lofty walls, and was strongly fortified.
The bishops were great territorial lords, and their
authority extended from Warwickshire to Bristol.
Henry II. and his queen were crowned in the
cathedral, and King John was buried there. Indeed,
few cities in England have been more connected
with events in history.</p>

<p>The courtyard of a house in Friar Street is a
good example of the street architecture of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Friar Street is
called from the house of Grey Friars that was
formerly situated at the north end of the street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>{72}</span></p>

<p class="nind">is now completely destroyed. The houses in Friar
Street afford an interesting series of the class of
building that prevailed during the reigns of the
Henrys and Elizabeth. The timber beams of
which the houses are constructed are piled up with
mortar or bricks, and whitewashed; while the
overhanging storeys, the high-pitched gables, the
lead lattices in the windows, and the rude grotesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>{73}</span>
ornaments, present an almost unique picture of an
English street.</p>

<p class="nind">memorable battle of Worcester, which ended the
prospects of the Stuart line for a time, a local
historian says, on the 3d September, after a skirmish
at Powick, the order was given by the king to
attack Cromwell, then lying at Perry Wood, about
a mile from the town. The contest commenced
rather late in the day, and it was in favour of the
Cavaliers, who compelled the Parliamentary troops
to abandon some of their guns; but reinforcements
arrived in great numbers from the other side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>{75}</span>
Severn to support the Republicans, and after maintaining
a very unequal combat for a long time the
king’s troops were obliged to retreat; a handful of
troops defended Sidbury gate, whilst the king
escaped from his pursuers. His Majesty, on entering
Sidbury, was obliged to dismount, and creep under
a waggon of hay which had been purposely upset
across the street at that part to impede the ingress
of his pursuers, and he entered the city on foot. A
horse was immediately brought ready saddled, by a
Mr. Badnall, who lived near Sidbury gate, and the
king was thus enabled to hasten to his quarters, at
a house in the corn market, from the back door of
which he escaped with Lord Wilmot, just as Col.
Cobbett reached the front in pursuit of him. Over
this house, which, as before said, is still standing in
the corn market, is the inscription, “Love God.
(W.B. 1557. R.D.) Honour the King.”</p>

<p>The illustration of the entrance into the Cathedral
Close represents the front of Edgar Tower
looking towards the east. It is said to be uncertain
if this building was designed by the castellans or
ecclesiastics, as there is some doubt concerning
the ownership of the site on which it stands; but
appearances, which, in the architecture of the
period, are a fair indication of such things, seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>{76}</span></p>

<p class="nind">rather to point out the former as having been the
original proprietors. Nor is there any record as to
the actual date of the building, which has often
been a subject of antiquarian doubt and speculation.
It seems that in the year 1730 two old English
letters, <span class="eng">M</span> and <span class="eng">W</span>, implying, as was supposed, the
date of 1005, were discovered by some workman
who was employed to repair the outside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>{77}</span>
building, but this cannot be relied on. All the
architecture that now is left would point to the age
of King John. “The general thickness of the
walls,” says Britton, “and the double gateway it
presents, show that it was intended to repel assailants,
and to protect the interior area and its
inhabitants from enemies.”</p>

<p>Other monarchs since Charles have visited
Worcester; especially to be noted are James II. and
George III. The latter presented his portrait to
the Corporation, and the former attended the
Cathedral on October 23, 1687, where it is
recorded that he touched several persons for
king’s evil, almost the last instance on record. His
successor William III. did certainly yield to sundry
entreaties to touch some sufferers, but he added,
“God give you better health and more sense.”</p>

<p>When King James visited the city he attended
mass at the old Catholic chapel, and was waited on
by the mayor and Corporation; but these dignitaries
objected to enter a Catholic place of worship, and
left him to enter alone. A minute in the Corporate
accounts seems to explain how the time was spent,
for they adjourned to the “Green Dragon,” and spent
the time in smoking and drinking till the service
was over, loyally charging their bill to the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>{78}</span></p>

<p>The next illustration is extremely interesting.
It represents the “New Inn” at Gloucester, and its
history is curious. Edward II. was murdered
under circumstances of great cruelty at Berkeley
Castle, and was interred in the Abbey Church of
Gloucester, a shrine being raised by the monks over
his remains. Lord Berkeley would, it is said, have
willingly protected the weak king, but he fell sick;
and Edward was given over one dark September
night to the tender mercies of “two hell-hounds,
that were capable of more villainous despite than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>{79}</span>
becomes either knights or the lewdest varlets in the
world,” Thomas Gurney and William Ogle. The
chronicler says that “screams and shrieks of anguish
were heard even so far as the town, so that many
being awakened therewith from their sleep, as they
themselves confessed, prayed heartily to God to
receive his soul, for they understood by those cries
what the matter meant.”</p>

<p>The New Inn was originally designed to accommodate
the pilgrims that the monks had been able
to collect to the shrine. The view of the courtyard
here given differs but little from its present appearance.
It has been slightly modernised, but all the
details remain to complete the present drawing,
which differs indeed but little from John Britton’s,
published in the early part of the present century.
Most of the pilgrims brought some offering with
them, and hence the pains that were taken for their
accommodation. The hotel built at Glastonbury for
a similar purpose still remains, and is the principal
one there at the present day. The buildings of
New Inn surrounded two square courts, and were
ascended by rows of steps&mdash;as appears in the engraving&mdash;communicating
with two rows of galleries,
and these led to various apartments and dormitories.
The present inn was built about the year 1450 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>{80}</span>
Northgate Street by John Twining; and the usual
tale about a subterraneous passage to the Cathedral
is handed down, which indeed corresponds with
the stories that are current of all religious houses.
There is a commonly received tradition among
country people in the neighbourhood of Chester
that a tunnel, closed up at each end, exists between
Chester Cathedral and Saighton Hall, a country-seat
of the abbots of Chester; and if such a passage
ever was constructed, it would compare rather
favourably with Cenis tunnel.</p>

<p>This inn is enormously strong and massive, and
covers a large area. It is said that half of it is
built of timber, principally chestnut.</p>

<p>The luxury of these roomy hotels, after a journey
that no market-cart in the most rural district in
England would now tolerate, must have been great
indeed. In the <i>Grand Concern of England explained
by a Lover of his Country</i>, 1673, we read,
“What advantage can it be to a man’s health to be
called out of bed into these coaches an hour or two
before day in the morning; to be hurried in them
from place to place till one, two, or three hours
within night, insomuch that, after sitting all day in
the summer time stifling with heat and choked with
dust, or in the winter time starving or freezing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>{81}</span></p>

<p class="nind">the cold, or choking with filthy fogs, they are often
brought into their inns by torchlight, when it is too
late to sit up and get a supper, and next morning
they are forced into the coach so early that they
cannot get breakfast? What addition is it to a
man’s health or business to ride all day with
strangers&mdash;oftentimes sick, ancient, diseased persons,
or young children crying,&mdash;all whose humors he is
obliged to put up with, and is often poisoned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>{82}</span>
their nasty scents, and crippled with the crowd of
boxes and bundles? Is it for a man’s health to be
laid fast in the foul ways and forced to wade up to
the knees in mire, afterwards sitting in the cold till
teams of horses can be sent to pull the coach out?
Is it for their health to travel in rotten coaches, and
to have their tackle, or perch, or axle-tree, broken,
and then to wait three or four hours (sometimes
half a day), and afterwards to travel all night to
make good their stage?”</p>

<p>The well-known scene from the Inn Yard,
Rochester, in <i>Henry IV.</i> illustrates all this, as also
the scarcity of clocks, and the necessity the inhabitants
were under to use any means at hand for
ascertaining the time of day or night. The
discomfort the picture presents will remind any one
of travelling in America where the train has to be
met at night, or early in the morning, and is
detained probably by snow or an accident. The
disjointed conversation and weariness are wonderfully
portrayed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Poor fellow! never joyed since the price of oats rose; it was the

<p>The condition of the roads may be gathered
from the fact, that though these men had not
more than some thirty miles to travel, they did
not expect to finish the journey till night. One
of them had a “gammon of bacon and two
razes of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing
Cross,” and the other was carrying live turkeys to
London, yet the carrier says, in answer to Gadshill,
that he hopes to be in London “time enough to
go to bed with a candle;” but there seems to have
been little improvement even up to the end of last
century, when a gentleman of landed property,
journeying from Glastonbury to Sarum in his
carriage, requested his footman to provide himself
with a good axe to lop off any branches of trees
that might obstruct the progress of his vehicle.
Indeed nobody knows what benefactors to their
race such men as Telford and Macadam have been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>{84}</span></p>

<p>In 1703 the road from Petworth to London was
so bad that the Duke of Somerset was obliged to
rest a night on his way to London, though this
distance was hardly fifty miles. And in March
1739 or 1740 Pennant, the author of the Journey
through Wales, travelled by stage, and in the first
day got with “much labour” from Chester to
Whitchurch, twenty miles; and, after a “wondrous
effort,” reached London before the commencement
of the sixth night.</p>

<p>The Inn at Tewkesbury, here shown, differs
from the last, as there is no quadrangle, and
probably it was not originally designed for a
hostelry, but it is drawn exactly as it now stands.
The New Inn at Gloucester has, however, been very
slightly modernised, very slightly indeed, and a
guest in this well-kept establishment might readily
condone any recent work. The view of Tewkesbury,
here given, is from the riverside, and shows the
monastic buildings converted into a mill.</p>

<p>There are not many streets or homesteads in
Cornwall of the character this work is intended to
illustrate.</p>

<p>Launceston is the old county town, and is
delightfully situated on the banks of the Attery; but
Bodmin is the place where assizes are now held,
and here Perkin Warbeck marshalled his Cornish
men prior to his march on Exeter. A curious story,
that dates back to the sixteenth century, is told of
the Mayor of Bodmin. He was directed by a king’s
officer to have a gallows erected for a person who
had been supposed to have some connection with a
recent rebellion. As soon as it was ready the
mayor was asked if it was strong enough to carry
him, and replied, “Without doubt it is.” “Then up
with you, Master Mayor,” he replied, “for it is
meant for thee.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>{86}</span></p>

<p>There are many traditions and ballads connected
with this charming county; but few persons will
forget the recent surprise they felt on learning that
the celebrated Cornish ballad, “And shall Trelawney
die?”&mdash;a ballad that Macaulay quotes as genuine&mdash;is
the composition of a clergyman who died recently,
and left a somewhat eccentric character behind him.</p>

<p>The old market-place and cross, Penzance, are
now being considerably modernised, but the engraving
here given faithfully represents it as it stood.
The market-place resembles the Rows at Totness,
or the half-developed Rows outside Chester, and the
crooked chimney-stack is supposed (perhaps rightly
too) to be a preventive to smoke.</p>

<p>Penzance is the most westerly town in England,
and has given birth to Sir Humphrey Davy and
Captain Pellew (Lord Exmouth). Liskeard, which
returns a member to Parliament, is described
correctly enough as a rather sleepy market-town;
and, with the exception of St. Germans, which was
once the cathedral city of Cornwall, there is little
connected with our present subject in this county.
This cannot, however, be said of Devonshire, which
abounds with quaint old towns and pleasant homesteads.
Here the artist goes for latticed cottage
windows, gables, and trellissed porches covered with
evergreens. The meadows are dotted with fine
timber trees, and narrow shady lanes lie through
rows of elms and beech trees, while nearly every
variety of wild flower and fern adorn the hedges.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that Thackeray laid the scene
of Pendennis’ early years in Devonshire. Clavering is
supposed to be Ottery St. Mary’s, Exeter figures as
Chatteris, and Baymouth of course is Exmouth.
Certainly the description of the place where Costigan
resided would seem to suit the Close of the ancient
city. “The captain conducted his young friend to
that quiet little street in Chatteris, which is called
Prior’s Lane, which lies in the ecclesiastical quarter
of the town, close by Dean’s Green and the canons’<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>{88}</span>
houses, and is overlooked by the enormous towers of
the cathedral; there the captain dwelt modestly in
the first floor of a low gabled house, on the door
of which was the brass-plate of “Creed, tailor and
robemaker.”</p>

<p>His description of Clavering St. Mary is very
beautiful; the river Brawl might be of course the
“Otter,” if the generally received opinion that Devonshire
is the scene of this delightful work is correct.
“Looking at the little old town of Clavering St.
Mary from the London Road, as it runs by the
lodge at Fairoaks, and seeing the rapid and shiny
Brawl winding down from the town, and skirting the
woods of Clavering Park, and the ancient church
tower and peaked roofs of the houses rising up
among trees and old walls, behind which swells a
fair background of sunshiny hills that stretch from
Clavering westward towards the sea, the place
looks so cheery and comfortable that many a
traveller’s heart must have yearned toward it from

in such a calm friendly nook he would like to shelter

<p>His description later on in the work, of the
inside of Clavering town, is marvellously graphic.
“Clavering is rather prettier at a distance than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>{89}</span>
on a closer acquaintance. The town, so cheerful of
aspect a few furlongs off, looks very blank and
dreary. Except on market-days there is nobody in
the streets. The clack of a pair of pattens rings
through half the place, and you may hear the
creaking of the rusty old ensign at the Clavering
Arms without being disturbed by any other noise.
There has not been a ball at the assembly rooms
since the Clavering volunteers gave one to their
colonel, old Sir Francis Clavering; the stables
which once held a great part of that brilliant, but
defunct regiment, are now cheerless and empty,
except on Thursdays when the farmers put up there,
and their tilted carts and gigs make a feeble show of
liveliness in the place, or on petty sessions when the
magistrates attend in what used to be the old cardroom.
On the south side of the market rises up the
church with its great gray towers, of which the sun
illuminates the delicate carving, deepening the
shadows of the huge buttresses, and gilding the
glittering windows and flaming vanes.... The
rectory is a stout broad-shouldered brick house of
the reign of Anne. It communicates with the
church and market by different gates, and stands at
the opening of Yew Tree Lane,” etc. etc. These
exquisite descriptions of old-fashioned English<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>{90}</span>
country town scenes are introduced as being among
the most vivid in our language, and also as referring,
it is supposed, to the places under consideration.</p>

<p>Exeter has declined from its ancient trade of
woollen manufacture, and glovemaking and agricultural
implements form the chief industry of the
inhabitants. Crediton, at a few miles farther up the
county, used at one time to be the seat of the
Episcopate, but Exeter has enjoyed that dignity
since the reign of Edward the Confessor. It has
played a conspicuous part at times in English
history, having at one time been besieged by
William the Conqueror; and when the magistrates
stole out of the city to surrender it, the citizens
closed their gates against their return, and took the
defence into their own hands. The fortifications
were destroyed by Fairfax in 1646; but part of the
castle still remains, and it has been converted into
a gentleman’s residence. Of this celebrated building
we read in Richard III. when his quarrel with
Buckingham is beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>Another old house opposite the cathedral in
Exeter is given which stands in a very irregular row.
This house is singular in form, and perhaps not a
specimen which will be imitated to any great extent
in the present day; still the bow windows over the

<p>Formerly an old building stood in Waterbeare
Street, which was said to be the Guildhall of Exeter,
and it would be the mayor’s place of business
when King Richard went to Exeter, but this was
pulled down in 1803. The present Guildhall in
High Street was built in 1593, though it is said that
the internal parts date back to the fourteenth
century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>{95}</span></p>

<p>The South gate of Exeter was taken down in
1819, and one of the most picturesque entrances to
any city lost for ever. Lysons has preserved a
drawing of it in his <i>Magna Britannia</i>, page 198,
that gives an excellent idea of its former grandeur;
a low deep archway, flanked by vast circular towers,
is encroached on upon all sides by picturesque
gabled houses, each built without any regard to the
style of its neighbour.</p>

<p>The Water gate also was taken down at nearly
the same time, and this has also been preserved in a
sketch in Lysons’ book. This gate was of astonishing
beauty and lightness.</p>

<p>A sketch of Plymouth harbour has been preserved
in a chart drawn by some engineer of the
reign of Henry VIII., and still extant in the British
Museum. The bird’s-eye view represents some
four churches, with plenty of gabled houses, and
the necessary number of lookers-on from men-of-war.</p>

<p>There are many other towns in Devonshire
that contain subject matter for our work, such as
Tiverton on the Exe, and Tavistock, so beautifully
situated on the banks of the Tavy. Tavistock once
gloried in a fine old Abbey, and much of the present
town is built out of the spoils of this venerable pile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>{96}</span>
of which some remains yet stand, and it was also the
birthplace of Sir Francis Drake.</p>

<p>Clovelly is one of the most picturesque villages
in England. The street resembles a winding staircase,
each house representing a step.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>This description of the village in <i>Enoch Arden</i>
has commonly been said to refer to Clovelly.</p>

<p>Often the towns and villages here receive their
names from rivers, for Devonshire has the honour
of a watershed of its own, of which Cranmere pool,
high up in Dartmoor, is the centre; thus Axminster
is named from having a minster on the Axe, and
Axmouth from being the town situated at the mouth
of that river. The Dart, of course, gives the name
of Dartmouth, and the Exe, Exeter and Exmouth;
and perhaps it is not commonly known that Mr.
Speaker Addington derived his title from the river
Sid, which runs past his property, and suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>{97}</span>
the name of Sydmouth to the original founder of the
family.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly too much to say that Wells
is the most picturesque city in England. The
series of houses called Vicar’s Close is connected
with the cathedral by a gallery, over an arched gateway
across the street. “This gallery is approached
on each side by a flight of steps, from which there
is a very fine and unique entrance into the chapter-room.
Unlike any other chapter-room in England,
the floor of this is raised several feet above the level
of the cathedral on a vaulted room. The design and
construction of this chapter-house, with its connecting
staircase and gallery, are entitled to the especial
admiration of the architect;” so writes Britton, and
he further adds, in admiration of the structure, “We
see that the architects of the Middle Ages were unrestrained
by precedent, and exercised their imagination
and judgment in producing novelties.”</p>

<p>The “Vicar’s Close” is a long court of ancient
houses built in the fourteenth century, and retaining
many of their original features; at one end is a noble
entrance gateway, and at the other the chapel and
chaplain’s dwelling. All these have been engraved
in Britton’s <i>Cathedral Antiquities</i> and <i>Picturesque
Antiquities of English Cities</i>. Each house has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>{98}</span>
tall graceful chimney rising through the eaves of the
roof, and is provided with a small garden in front.
These shafts have armorial bearings of the see&mdash;and
of the executors of Bishop Beckington, who finished
the “Close.” Their names were Swan and Sugar,
and in the spirit of the age, a swan and a loaf of sugar
have been sculptured. This singular scene has no
rival in England, and nowhere can mediæval domestic
architecture be so well studied. The combinations
of chimneys and gables, buttresses and traceried
windows, is really astonishing to any one who sees
it for the first time.</p>

<p>Wells, according to Camden, was so called from
its numerous springs, and now bright clear water
runs through the various streets of the city, which
take their rise from wells in the Bishop’s garden,
these wells form a moat or lake of incomparable
beauty. The engraving gives only a partial idea of
the scene, as each step unfolds some new delight.
There is an embattled wall with bastion towers,
enclosing perhaps fifteen acres, which is surrounded
by a broad moat, and on the north side the palace is
approached by a bridge and baronial gatehouse.
Ralph de Salopia was the builder of this wall, and a
great benefactor to the see and palace. He it was
who drew up statutes for the government of Vicar’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>{99}</span></p>

<p>Close in 1347. Whatever this prelate undertook he
would seem to have done with vigour, for, as he was
partial to the chase in his leisure hours, he pursued
it with such success, that during his prelacy he is
said to have destroyed the game of the vast
Mendip forest; but one of his predecessors, who
bore an excellent name, Reginald Fitz Joceline,
seems to have smoothed the way for the pursuit of
hunting, as he obtained a charter from Richard I.
entitling all bishops of Wells to keep dogs for
hunting throughout the entire county of Somerset.
He was much esteemed in his day, and relieved the
citizens of Wells from some servile duties. This
excellent man, when offered the dignity of archbishop,
replied with emotion, that “so far was he
from having any ambitious desire for that place,
that it was a great grief unto him to be chosen, and
he would be very glad if they would take some
other in his room: howbeit,” says he, “if they must
needs stand to their election, though with grief and
sorrow I must and will accept the same.” His “nolo
episcopari” was not put to any very severe test,
however, for though he reluctantly permitted his
nomination, he never enjoyed the dignity, for he
was very soon after taken ill, put on a monk’s cowl,
and died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>{100}</span></p>

<p>The beneficence of this prelate in procuring the
right to keep hunting dogs for all clergy is
celebrated apparently in the monument of Ralph de
Salopia, who has two dogs collared at his feet on
the effigy in Wells Cathedral.</p>

<p>Little would all this advantage another bishop
of later date whose name is intimately connected
with the scene here given,&mdash;Bishop Ken. He was
one of the “seven bishops” who was tried in James
II.’s time, and in a summer-house from which this
beautiful scene is taken, he wrote the <i>Morning and
Evening Hymns</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to travel far in Glastonbury without
being reminded of its once famous monastery. The
buildings are either constructed from its spoils, or
else are themselves parts of the original structure,
and many walls and farm buildings in the neighbourhood
owe their existence to materials quarried
as it were from its vast stores. The durability of the
stone is something marvellous: most of the enrichments
on the chapel of St. Joseph, though they date
back to the thirteenth century, are as perfect as when
first chiselled, and retain all their original sharpness.
The Tribunal here shown was intended for very
different purposes than a suite of lawyer’s offices, to
which use it is now adapted. It is fortunate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span></p>

<p class="nind">it remains at all, as its destruction was decreed, but a
gentleman in the neighbourhood, a son of the late
Dean of Windsor, came forward and purchased it;
he now represents the county in Parliament. The
oriel window and deeply-recessed lights of the lower
storey have a very venerable appearance. The
tower is characteristic of the Somerset towers of the
fifteenth century. A little lower down on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span>
side of the street is the celebrated “George Inn,”
built for the convenience of the Pilgrims, and this
yet remains as an inn, and is the best in
Glastonbury. A gatehouse with some fine work
inside, forms another inn, not very far distant. The
tradition of “Weary-all-Hill” is so familiar as hardly
to need repeating here. It says that Joseph of
Arimathea, toiling up the steep ascent, drove his
thorn staff into the ground, and said to his followers,
“Here let us rest.” This was regarded as an omen,
and to it the monastery owed its origin. The thorn
budded, and now flowers, it is commonly said, at
winter. The grand Abbot’s kitchen is familiar to
every one, and it is said to be owing to a boast of
the last Abbot, when Henry VIII. threatened to
burn down his buildings, that he would have a
kitchen all the wood of Mendip Forest would not
suffice to burn down. Here St. Patrick spent the
latter part of his life, and here also, it is said, King
Arthur was buried.</p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis says he was an eyewitness
of his disinterment in the twelfth century, on the return
of Henry II. from the Irish wars; and seven feet
below the surface a large stone was discovered with
the inscription “<small>HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLYTUS REX
ARTHURIUS IN INSULA AVALONIA</small>.” Nine feet below<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span>
this they found the remains of the King, and by his
side those of his wife. The shin-bone of the King,
says Giraldus, when placed side by side with that
of a tall man, reached three fingers above his knee,
and his skull was fearfully wounded. The remains
of his wife were singularly perfect, but fell into dust
on exposure to the atmosphere,&mdash;a statement that
seems rather to confirm than otherwise the curious
discovery, for some similar phenomena have occurred
among much more ancient remains, as ancient indeed
as the mysterious people of Etruria.</p>

<p>Edward I., it is said, had these remains subsequently
exhumed. The skulls were deposited in
the Treasury, to remain there, and the rest of the
bones were returned to their resting-place, Edward
placing an inscription over them, which recorded the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Though Dorsetshire is rich in relics of the
Roman and Celtic period, the towns generally have
a somewhat modern appearance. Sherborne is
finely situated in the northern part of the county,
on the slope of a hill rising from the vale of Blackmoor,
and was a place of importance even in the
early Saxon times; indeed it was for three centuries
the seat of a bishopric, which included the southwestern
counties. The see was afterwards removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span>
to Old Sarum. Sherborne Castle was the seat of
Sir Walter Raleigh, who received the estate from
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The scene here given is a beautiful example of
a quiet English market-place. There is a water
conduit to supply the townspeople, and behind it is
a covered area much resembling a market cross, and
apparently built about the year 1500. On market-days,
when there are groups of farmers and country
people round the space in front of the “Sun Inn”
the effect is very picturesque; the huge abbey rises
over all, and forms a fine gray background, and, as
will be seen, the rest of the picture is finely broken.</p>

<p>Weymouth is the largest town in Dorsetshire,
and it has many interesting traditions connected
with it. It was one of the principal harbours of the
south when the Spanish Armada appeared on our
shores, and Queen Elizabeth united it with Melcombe
Regis, in order to end the constant lawsuits
that were carried on between these two places to
secure the rights of harbour. Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire,
has played no inconsiderable a part in English
history. It contributed four ships to the Calais
expedition of Edward III. In 1544 the French
landed here, but were repulsed with great slaughter.
A century later it held out for two months against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">C</span><span class="letra2">ARDINAL BEAUFORT’S</span> Tower was built
in the early part of the fifteenth century, when
he revived the foundation of St. Cross. To the left
of the illustration is the brewery, formerly called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span>
Hundred Men’s Hall, because a hundred of the
poorest inhabitants of Winchester were daily entertained
to dinner here, and, as that repast was provided
on a very bountiful scale, the guests were
always permitted to carry provisions to their families.
This tower and the buildings around it are noble
examples of the domestic architecture of the fifteenth
century. The dwellings of the brethren consist of a
parlour, bedroom, scullery, and closet; they are beautiful
examples of old cottage architecture, and are compactly
planned. In this hospital the custom yet
prevails of giving any wayfarer who may ask it a
horn of ale and a dole of bread. The ale is brewed
on the premises, and is said to be the same kind as
that which was brewed here hundreds of years ago.
The revenues of this building were till lately enormous,
and much dissatisfaction is openly expressed
at the way in which one high in office, recently
appropriated the greater part of them. Nothing
can exceed the beauty of St. Cross as it is approached
from the Southampton road. This noble
gateway is seen through great elms and walnut
trees, and the long lines of quaint high chimneys,
combining with the church and foliage, are astonishingly
picturesque. The river Itchen sometimes is
well in view along the road, and sometimes it is lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span>
in the trees. The hospital itself, with the brethren
in their black gowns and silver crosses, gives, perhaps,
a more vivid picture of ancient England,
and that in its best features, than any other scene
that is left us.</p>

<p>Just a mile from this charming spot is the West
Gate of Winchester. Formerly there were four
gates, but three have been demolished. The one
here shown is said (probably with accuracy) to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span>
been built by King John. It is unnecessary, however,
to remark that later architecture has been
introduced. There is a strong room on the ground-floor,
called a cage, that was for the temporary
confinement of disorderly persons, and till lately it
was used for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>The beautiful “Cross” at Winchester is supposed
by Britton to have been erected by Cardinal Beaufort.
The cardinal is said to have spent much of
his ill-gotten wealth in splendid architectural works.
His wealth was prodigious, even for a high prelate
of those days. In the fine scene which closes his
career in “Henry VI.,” he says in his last moments&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div>

<p>The probability is that the great dramatist more
nearly hit off the truth of the last hours and crimes
of the great churchman than ordinary history has
done.</p>

<p>The Cathedral Close at Winchester is extremely
picturesque, and the little houses round it are of
considerable antiquity. If the visitor enters the
church from the west end, the scene is of almost
unequalled grandeur. He looks through one continuous
vista of pillars, arches, and roof, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span></p>

<p class="nind">to the eastern extremity, where the eye finally rests
on the great eastern window, that seems to dimly
light up the choir. The size of this magnificent
vista may best be understood if we consider that a
journey from the west door to the east window and
back is only some eighty yards short of a quarter of
a mile. It is curious that Winchester is really cased
in and hidden by a more recent style, in order to
adapt it to the more modern styles of thought and
practice; and I am indebted to Mr. Barry for
bringing forward the following problem:&mdash;How is it
that in the Georgian era the great rage was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>{111}</span>
pulling down dwelling-houses, and, indeed, unhappily,
other buildings of a secular character, cathedrals and
parish churches were spared, especially as they were
all generally classified under the term of Gothic, or
barbarous? Gothic, it must always be remembered,
is the term of reproach that Wren applied to all
mediæval architecture, though it has now been converted
into a word of praise. Vandalism was the

<p>These are the crowd that Cowper alludes to
when describing the burning of Lord Mansfield’s
library. The second term only now is ever
used in reproach, the first being almost, as before
remarked, a complimentary epithet. Happily it is
so, or else the cathedrals would have fallen in the
fashion of the period that made each new era in
design paramount for the time. Nothing can have
been less conservative than the way in which the
monks of old regarded the works of their predecessors.
In any English cathedral we see the masonry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>{112}</span>
of different eras, each with its own peculiarity, and
there was not the slightest hesitation in pulling
down the works of the previous century in order to
replace them with those in fashion; indeed we often
find exquisite carved work broken in pieces and
used for rubble, when its very condition shows that
the builders who so used it could have easily restored
it&mdash;not “restored” in the modern sense of the
word, but repaired it. To be so conservative as we
are now of the works of our ancestors in an age
that is pre-eminently one of progress, seems an
anachronism, but it must be remembered that we
should not now have possessed much in the way of
cathedrals if it were not for the fact that after the
Reformation, clergy fell almost into contempt for a
long time. Macaulay’s <i>History of England</i> tells us
how lightly they were esteemed; a chaplain to a
family of rank and wealth was hardly held in greater
honour than the head gamekeeper or huntsman; and
the wealth of the bishops and dignitaries seems
almost to have isolated rather than enabled them to
mingle with their equals. Ecclesiastical buildings
were therefore neglected, happily for the present
generation, or else we should have had a dozen
grand old Gothic piles replaced by the architecture
of Queen Anne or the Georges. The tide of improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>{113}</span>
that swept away so many old English
mansions passed by them.</p>

<p>Surrey is a very beautiful county, undulating
and diversified. A great part of it is not more than
300 feet above the level of the sea, and Leith Hill,
near Dorking, which is the highest part of it, is only
about 900 feet in elevation. There are many old
towns and villages in Surrey, and not a few are of
great historical interest. Esher is the place where
Cardinal Wolsey was ordered to retire to after his
downfall. The gateway still remains of Esher
Palace. It is a fine old tower, with turrets at the
angles. Norfolk gives the&mdash;to him&mdash;congenial

<p>The Town-hall of Guildford is a very characteristic
building of the earliest period of classic revival.
I saw a painting of it that dated back to the earlier
part of last century, and the street seems hardly to
have been altered since this picture was executed.
The balcony is of course for addressing an audience
at election times, and the clock stands quaintly out
into the street, supported by thin ribbons of wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span></p>

classic buildings of the period when the revival took
place, came from Holland, and the stiff gardening
was introduced from the Netherlands, though of
course the Dutch element is more observable in
places like Hull, that had more direct communication
with the Low Countries. The revivals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span>

gateway is shown here, but these walls were the

<p>See of Salisbury was removed from Old Sarum in
1215 to its present site, in consequence of the
“brawles and sadde blows,” as Holinshed states,
between the clergy and the castellans, and then the
splendid cathedral was commenced. King Henry
III. granted the church a weekly market, and a
fair of eight days’ continuance; and, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>{118}</span>
Dodsworth’s <i>Salisbury</i>, “the city was divided into
spaces of seven perches each in length, and three
in breadth,” and this accounts for the present symmetrical
arrangement of the streets.</p>

<p>The view in the High Street, looking into the
close, shows one of the entrance gatehouses. It is,
of course, of later date than the Cathedral, but
extremely fine, and characteristic of ancient English
architecture. The view of Salisbury from the bridge
includes the present workhouse&mdash;the building on
the right. There is a fine old chapel here, and a
curiously ornamented chimney-piece, and also an
apartment Britton calls a “monks’ parlor.”</p>

<p>Surrey, from its position, has often occupied a
conspicuous place in English history, and it is hardly
necessary to add that Runnymede, near Egham,

<p>Canterbury is one of the most delightful cities in
England for an antiquary. Not much remains of its
military antiquities, but the ecclesiastical and domestic
relics are numerous and imposing. St.
Augustine’s monastery is worth a pilgrimage from
any part of England, and notwithstanding all it has
suffered from having been used as a brewery, it
bears many grand traces of its ancient splendour.</p>

<p>Mercery Lane, which is here shown, is one of
the ancient narrow streets of the city, and the engraver
has given an excellent idea of its present
appearance. The houses on each side are two
storeys higher, and that would still further seem to
contract its width; but the Cathedral, and the Christ
Church gateway that shuts off the Cathedral precincts,
and appears to span the street, are very well
given.</p>

<p>This is the principal gateway to the close, and
was built by Prior Goldstone in 1517. The octagonal
sides were formerly surmounted by elegant
turrets, but these have been taken down as low as
the battlements. The arms of Becket are carved on
one of the spandrels, and there is an inscription:&mdash;“<span class="smcap">HOC
OPUS CONSTRUCTUM EST ANNO DOMINI MILESSIMO
QUINGENTESSIMO DECIMO SEPTIMO.</span>” The effect

<p>There are not a few black-and-white gabled
houses still standing in Canterbury, and now all
antiquities are preserved with jealous care. The
small houses shown at end of this chapter are
characteristic of the humbler dwellings of the city,
and show how low a room was sometimes considered
to be sufficient. According to Geoffrey of
Monmouth a British town stood here as far back as
nine centuries before the Christian era; but the
Romans early established a colony here, and
changed the old British name to Durovernum. A
view of a Roman gateway is still given in Gostling’s
<i>Walks</i>, and another Roman gateway was taken
down in 1790.</p>

<p>Falstaff Inn is an ancient hostelry of very considerable
merit as to its present accommodation.
The signboard projects to an extraordinary extent
into the road, and is supported by elaborate wrought
iron work.</p>

<p>The west gate, which is shown in the same engraving,
is the only one of the six ancient barriers of
Canterbury. Britton tells us that it was built by
Archbishop Sudbury, who proposed to erect strong
defences at each entrance to the city, and connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>{122}</span></p>

<p class="nind">them all by walls, which should completely surround
it. “The barbarous murder of that active and
benevolent prelate by the insurgents under Wat
Tyler on Tower Hill, June 14, 1381, put an end to
this among many other appropriate and useful improvements
planned for the advantage of his metropolitan
city. The gatehouse he, however, completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span>
and it is an interesting feature among the numerous
antiquities of the place. It crosses the high road
from London to Dover, and serves as a protection
to the bridge over the western branch of the Stour,
which at this place is only a small stream. It is
embattled and machicolated, and the grooves still
remain which directed the fall of the portcullis.
The arch is of subsequent date, and forms part of
the reparations effected by Archbishop Juxon after
the disturbance occasioned by the puritanical Mayor
at Christmas 1647. The centre is flanked by the
very lofty and spacious round towers, the foundations
of which are laid in the river Stour. They are
divided into two storeys, and are pierced with loopholes
having circular endings, similar to those
observable in the remains of the fortifications near
Dane-John-Hill, and are embattled.” This gatehouse,
when Britton wrote his description, was
used as the city prison both for criminals and
debtors.</p>

<p>Canterbury is always associated with Chaucer’s
wonderful work, the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, and the
accurate insight that this gives into the manners and
customs of the time. The Tabard, afterwards the
Talbot in Southwark, retained till comparatively
recent times many of the features of the hostelry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span>
that it had when Chaucer described it. The landlord
was a man of great mark, and his social importance
is rather startling to our present ideas. His
guests were composed of all ranks of people, and
after their dinner was over he proposed a journey
to Canterbury at his own cost and charges, and that
he should judge the best story that any of them
could narrate on the road, being “wise and well
ytaught” himself. Chaucer’s characters of the
guests are wonderfully clever and lifelike, even at
the present day; but it is rather curious to find him
so outspoken against the monk and friar, and contrasting
them with the “poure parson of a town,”
and “the clerk of Oxenford.” The former seems
to have suggested Goldsmith’s village parson, and
indeed it is impossible to read Chaucer’s description
without being reminded of almost parallel
passages, though Goldsmith’s are of course so much
sweeter.</p>

<p>“Fenced around with barbican and bastion on
the one hand, and girded by high walls towards the
river, the legal and baronial occupiers of Rochester
Castle sat in safety,” says the historian, “whether
dispensing the rude justice to trembling serfs, or
quaffing the red wine among their knightly
retainers.” The last repairs the castle received<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>{125}</span>
were at the hands of the possessor in Edward VI.’s
time. James I. granted it to Sir Anthony
Welldone, and his descendant Walker Welldone,
according to Grose, “sold the timbers of it to one
Gimmit, and the stone stairs, and other squared and
wrought stone of the windows and arches, to
different masons in London; he would likewise have
sold the whole materials of the castle to a paviour,
but on an essay made on the east side, near the
postern leading to Bully Hill, the effects of which
are seen in a large chasm, the mortar was found so
hard that the expense of separating these stones
amounted to more than their value, by which this
noble pile escaped a total demolition.” The streets
of Rochester, though they contain many beautiful
houses of ancient date, can boast of little, if anything
at all, equal to the castle in antiquity. There is one
very fine gabled residence, now used as a school, on
the south side of the city. The gateway called the
College Gate is here shown. It is built of oak, with
clinker boarding, and is extremely picturesque.
The street in which it stands leads up to the
cathedral precincts. The ancient house architecture
of Kent is very valuable for examples. In the
neighbourhood of Broadstairs the chimneys, both
of brick and stone, afford a great store of quaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span>
examples for this little understood branch of building.
And all antiquarians are indebted to Kent as
being the home of Camden, the greatest of antiquaries,
who died at Camden Place in 1623, at the
residence where the Emperor Napoleon III. expired
exactly 250 years later.</p>

though it has many quaint old street scenes.
Chichester is rather disappointing to those who see
it for the first time, and know it by its old cross and
cathedral. There still remain in the upper part of
South Street some houses with overhanging
cornices, that are attributed, and in all probability
accurately so, to Sir Christopher Wren. The Cross
has often been described and drawn, and is a
thoroughly good example of street architecture. It
is quite impossible to do more than hurry over this
county. Winchelsea was added to the Cinque Ports
before the reign of King John, and in the reign of
Henry VI. it was the principal port of embarkation
for the continent. The Land Gate, the Strand Gate,
and the New Gate, three out of its old gateways, are
still standing, though they are rather ruinous, and
Winchelsea itself is in a state of decay, hardly being
more now than a village.</p>

<p>Rye is about two miles to the north-east of
Winchelsea, and is a very ancient town with grass-grown
streets. They are nearly all narrow, steep,
and very winding. Rye is one of the Cinque Ports,
like Winchelsea, and as yet its harbour continues to
be of some little consequence. The church clock,
which is still in use, is said to be the most ancient in
England. The gabled houses here shown are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>{128}</span>
characteristic of the town, and much resemble those
in Chester and Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>It has been said that it is difficult to decide if
this rather familiar style of building which still
adorns so many of our older county towns is an
adaptation of a still older form. “Owing to constant
improvement,” says an author of a paper read before<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>{129}</span>
the Liverpool Architectural Society, “it is impossible
to determine exactly the various periods,
because old timbers and productions in wood were
used in the construction of new houses. For the
same reason it is difficult to say whether examples
were new in design or copies from earlier buildings.
Such an instance we have in the ceiling of Neworth
Castle, which is richly carved, and bears the character
of the fourteenth century, although the structure
was rebuilt almost entirely towards the close of
Queen Elizabeth’s reign.” We have already
remarked on the former part of this sentence, as
illustrated in so many street fronts in Chester, and
for the second part, there is no doubt that the
ordinary street architecture of Queen Elizabeth’s
time, where it had none of the peculiarities introduced
by Thorpe into the country, was similar to
that which existed for centuries before. It is quite
possible that the house in Shrewsbury where Richmond
lodged before the battle of Bosworth<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was of
some age then&mdash;indeed, there are reasons for supposing
so; yet there is no characteristic in it that would
distinguish it from a town house of Charles II.’s
time, unless, of course, the latter had some enrichment.
East Grinstead is seated on a hill near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>{130}</span>
borders of Sussex. It contains many very interesting
half-timbered houses, not dissimilar in
character to the illustrations from Rye. The
one we have shown is a characteristic stone
house, with a fine massive chimney and mullioned
windows.</p>

<p>If some sort of a consecutive order is to be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>{131}</span>
in the counties, Middlesex would almost seem to
follow Kent and Surrey, and London is yet full
of quaint old relics like Staples Inn, Lincoln’s Inn,
Crosby Hall, the interesting streets at the north side
of St. Paul’s. There is also much curious architecture
in the buildings of the twelve great guilds, and
in the squares and streets round Russell Square are
many fine old remains of Queen Anne’s time.
Many of these are turned into lodging-houses, or
let off in flats to professional men; but one thing is
certain, there is a wealth of old city architecture
inside London houses that would surprise many an
old inhabitant.</p>

<p>This is more valuable now since the revival, by
Mr. Norman Shaw, of the Queen Anne architecture;
not that it necessarily should supersede all other
styles, or any other, but there are places where it
might have its use, and form a valuable addition to
the picturesque appearance of the landscape. But
in coming to London after the streets and homesteads
we have been considering, one feels almost
like a country cousin that has arrived from the
shires. Anything that can be said is so well known
already by nearly all the residents. Every spot
round London is classic ground. Hampstead,

Pretender; and hundreds of other similar spots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>{133}</span>

The capital town of Hertford is small, and though

numerous public buildings,

octagonal window which

<span class="caption">ST. ALBANS’ CLOCK TOWER.</span>
</div>

<p>St. Albans is situated in this county, and is in
the hundred of Cashio. The ancient name was
Verulam, a name taken from the small river Ver,
upon whose banks it is built. The Abbey of St.
Albans rose in importance before any in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>{137}</span>
kingdom, not excluding even Glastonbury, and
from its walls the earliest printed books in England
were issued. The curious clock tower here engraved
stands at the junction of two streets, and
is not, as might be supposed, some part of an
old church, indeed it is said never to have had
any other use than the one for which it is at
present used.</p>

<p>The vicinity we are now in reminds us of the
name of the man who probably invented the style
of architecture which we call Elizabethan, that is
the curiously broken classic style so peculiar to
England, and now so popular. Thorpe designed
Hatfield, Wollaton, Holland House, and many other
well-known residences, and it is almost by an
accident that his name has escaped oblivion. He
left behind him a large volume of designs, which is
now in the Soane museum. This volume was lent
by the Earl of Warwick to Horace Walpole for his
work on the <i>Anecdotes of English Art</i>, and Walpole
writes of it&mdash;“By the favour of the Earl of
Warwick I am enabled to bring to light a very
capital artist, who designed or improved most of the
principal and palatial edifices erected in the reigns
of Elizabeth and James I., even though his name
was totally forgotten.” It is believed that his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a>{138}</span>
was not known to Wren, Vanbrugh, or Gibbs, and
yet he was the author of a style that has been
introduced into every county in England. This
folio of designs was purchased by Soane. Among
other plans is one of a house fantastically designed
for himself, forming the letters I T joined by a
corridor, and under is the eccentric couplet&mdash;</p>

<span class="i7"><span class="smcap">John Thorpe.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But I remember seeing a notice of this able man
and his eccentricity in an old book, where he wrote
a rhyming epitaph upon himself. Some of his
friends were asked by him in his last illness to compose
one that should rhyme, and be very short, and
he fairly eclipsed all their productions by his own,
“Thorpe’s corpse.” This architect seems to have
resided in Paris for some little time, and been employed
in designing alterations for the Luxembourg,
in the Faubourg St. Germain.</p>

<p>This volume in the Soane Museum contains a
number of plans, some of which have been reproduced
by Richardson and others.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Tudor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>{139}</span>
sovereigns especially favoured Hertfordshire. The
children of Henry VIII. lived at Hunsdon; and at
Hatfield Palace, now the residence of the Marquis
of Salisbury, resided Edward VI. and Elizabeth.
Cardinal Wolsey had an estate at Cheshunt, near
Waltham.</p>

<p>Aylesbury ought perhaps to be considered the
county town of Buckingham, since the assizes are
held there. The view here given is from one
corner of the market square, and it just discloses

<span class="caption">KING’S HEAD INN, AYLESBURY.</span>

<p class="nind">and high chimneys; the rest of the square is
modern. The population of Aylesbury does not
exceed some 7000, but it has played many important
parts in English history. It was strongly
fortified by the Britons, and resisted the attacks of
the Saxons till Cuthwolf captured it in 571. William
the Conqueror rewarded one of his followers with
the estate, and 600 years after this it formed an
important post of the Parliamentarian army. The
old King’s Head, here shown, was at one time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>{141}</span>
head-quarters for the troopers. Buckingham is not
a very interesting town, but two of the bridges in it
are extremely ancient. Catherine of Arragon took
up her abode here in her restless life, after being
separated from King Henry. The town was nearly
burned to the ground in 1725, and that accounts for
its comparatively modern and insignificant appearance.</p>

<p>The ancient town of Marlow is also situated in
the southern part of this county, and the quiet rich
beauty of the scenery round it is not surpassed in
any part of England.</p>

<p>Stony Stratford was one of the resting-places of
Queen Eleanor, and Edward I. erected a beautiful
cross here, which unhappily has been destroyed.
Here also Richard III., when Duke of Gloucester,
seized the uncles of Edward V., and sent them with
Sir Thomas Vaughan to Pontefract.</p>

<p>Colchester in Essex was formerly a walled town,
and traces of the walls still remain. They are
nearly eight feet in thickness. The manufacture of
baize was introduced here in Queen Elizabeth’s time,
and many Flemish names and faces are to be found
among the inhabitants. Maldon, in this county, and
Braintree, contain many old buildings. Waltham
Abbey and Waltham Cross are familiar to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>{142}</span>

ourselves that such splendid relics have been spared

This is the only illustration

such places as Steventon,
Abingdon with its thousand associations, Cumnor,
and the many places of interest in the Vale of the
White Horse. Bray is in the eastern part of the
county, near Maidenhead, and is celebrated for its
vicar, who changed his religion four times during
the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and
Elizabeth; and in reply to one of his parishioners
who accused him of inconsistency, he said he
adhered strictly to his principles, which were to live

<p>In approaching such a county as Oxford, the
difficulty is to deal with subjects that are not already
too familiar. The city of Oxford has been described
a hundred times, and Pugin and Le Keux
have almost exhausted its picturesque colleges and
halls in their woodcuts and steel engravings.
Woodstock is one of the first places an Oxford
student or his friends visit, and great as the attractions
of its park or palace may be, there is little in
it that comes within the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>Banbury, in the northern part of the county, is
an admirable example of a fine old English town.
Its noble church was, it is said, destroyed by an alderman
who was also a builder, and who erected the present
unsightly edifice in its place. The Castle of
Banbury, which was built by the Bishop of Lincoln
in the twelfth century, stood a long siege during the
wars of Charles I., and the Parliamentarians ordered
its demolition when they obtained possession of it.
The bars, five in number, were standing until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>{144}</span>
present century, but now they are destroyed. The
names are peculiar, and differ considerably from
those we commonly find applied to city gates: St.
John’s Bar, Sugar Bar, North Bar, Cole Bar, and
Bridge Gate. The old Banbury cross, familiar in
nursery rhymes, has lately been destroyed.</p>

<p>The Roebuck Inn is an extremely fine piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>{145}</span>
architecture. The great window on the left lights
a still finer room. Indeed this chamber, with which
the low door communicates, is one of the most
beautiful apartments of the early part of Queen
Elizabeth’s reign in England. It is exceedingly
rich in ornament, and all the ornaments are in excellent
taste. It is now used as a club room, or for
any large gathering that the inn&mdash;which is a very
unassuming hostelry&mdash;may have to accommodate.
The inn faces the street, and the beam on the upper
part of the picture is the end of the passage leading
to the courtyard in which this room is situated.
The room was the council-chamber of Oliver Cromwell
after the taking of Banbury Castle. The
quaint gables that form the subject of the next
illustration are very characteristic of the town.
There seems to be no particular history connected
with them, but they were not very new at the
siege of Banbury. There is one rather singular
house here with three even gables in the front,
which project into the street to an enormous distance,
and are enriched in parquetry. Three
circular bow windows, also projecting into the street,
are exactly under them, and stop on their soffits,
but the gables project considerably beyond the bow
windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>{146}</span></p>

<p>Entering Oxford from the railway we cross over
a bridge, and under it is the picturesque scene here
given. The houses are rather old, and not perhaps
very desirable as residences, but the effect is very
good indeed, and much resembles a view on the
Witham in Lincoln, that will form the subject of
another engraving.</p>

<p>Tetsworth, on the London and Oxford road, is a
perfect specimen of an old English coaching town,
but its glories have declined, of course, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>{147}</span>
days of railroads. Dorchester is an ancient village,
and contains the cathedral church of St. Peter and
St. Paul, full of venerable memorials, and the embankments
called Dyke Hills were thrown up as
old fortifications in the Roman times.</p>

<p>But, of course, the chief interest of the county
centres in the capital city. The great Oxford historian
Anthony-a-Wood tells us that many of the
students were “mere varlets, who pretended to be
scholars, who lived under no discipline, neither had
any tutors, but only for fashion sake would sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>{148}</span>
thrust themselves into the schools of ordinary
lectures; and when they went to perform any
mischief, then they would be accounted scholars,
that so they might free themselves from the jurisdiction
of the burghers.” This was the benefit of
clergy! The professors of learning there, Franciscan
friars, were men of very high character, and free
from any suspicion of worldly ambition; indeed
Chaucer well describes them in the Oxford Clerk.
“The hilly nature of the roads,” says the topographer,
“leading to Oxford, makes the city present
a magnificent appearance to the traveller as he
approaches it, for stretched out before him lies a
succession of spires, towers, domes, and public
edifices, between which and the rivers extend a
number of beautiful luxuriant meadows; nor is he
disappointed upon his entrance into the city, for
each street presents some building which compels
him to stop and admire either its construction or its
antiquity. Entering by the London road, and thus
traversing Oxford from east to west, we pass
Magdalen College with its tower of eight pinnacles,
University College, Queen’s College, All Souls’
College, St. Mary’s Church, and All Saints’ Church,
a picturesque series of colleges and churches interspersed
with antique and modern houses. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a>{149}</span></p>

<p class="nind">the Abingdon branch of the London Road the
entrance is not quite so effective, but the line of
streets running from north to south contains St.
Giles’ Church, etc.; the Martyrs’ Memorial, erected
in memory of the burning of Cranmer, Latimer, and
Ridley, in Queen Mary’s reign. The quiet which
characterises its streets, the constant sound of bells
summoning to study or prayer, and the absence of
heavy traffic, distinguish it from ordinary cities.”</p>

<p>But the college that is perhaps the most beloved
by Englishmen is Magdalen, owing to its spirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>{150}</span>
opposition to the attempts which James II. made to
tyrannise over its authorities and rights. The tower
of Merton Chapel, here given, is extremely well
proportioned, and forms a pleasing object in High
Street. The tower and transept seem to have more
recent characteristics than the body of the chapel,
which is Late Decorated, and not very happy.
Speaking of the foundation of this college, a careful
writer says: “No regular plan of the regime of
Oxford can be found till the foundation of Merton
College by Roger de Merton in 1247, but his
statutes were gradually adopted with alterations by
other succeeding colleges. These facts, on the
whole, give us a kind of glimpse of the foundation
of the present university. And comparatively
rude and simple as the arrangements no doubt
were, as compared with the elaborate system that
now prevails, there is one startling fact in connection
with this foundation or revival of University
College&mdash;there were then 15,000 scholars at the
university of Oxford. It is a common remark that
this and the 30,000 students of the reign of Henry
III. are mere exaggerations, but apparently the
assertion is made on no better foundation than the
fact that no such state of things prevails now. All
Souls’ College, a little farther on, has a fine irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>{151}</span></p>

<p class="nind">front to the street, and is really an excellent example
of street architecture. It is “the college of the
Souls of all faithful people deceased of Oxford,”
seeming, as has been said, to convey the idea of a
spiritual cemetery. Jeremy Taylor, Bishop Heber,
and Sir Christopher Wren were educated here. It
appears that the idea so quaintly expressed was
chiefly intended to praying for the good estate of
Henry VI., Archbishop Chicheley, who was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>{152}</span>
founder, and also for the souls of Henry V., the
Duke of Clarence, and of all those dukes, earls,
barons, knights, and esquires that had fallen in the
war with France.” One of the finest libraries in
England is to be found at All Souls; “it measures,”
the authority quoted from says, “190 feet in length
by 32½ in breadth, swelling out in the centre to
above 50 feet, whilst the height, 40 feet, is sufficient
to allow of a gallery that extends round three sides
of the room.” The collection of books is among
the finest even in Oxford.</p>

<p>Magdalen College is a noble piece of architecture
from whatever side it is viewed. By the <i>Oxford
University Calendar</i> it appears that it was founded
in 1458 by William de Waynflete, who was successively
head-master of Winchester and Eton
Colleges, Provost of Eton, Bishop of Winchester, and
at the same time Lord High Chancellor of England.
He had once been master of Magdalen Hospital,
near Winchester, and that, doubtless, suggested the
name of his college at Oxford. The part of the
quadrangle here shown certainly seems to be of a
later date than the foundation of the college. As far
as the style of design goes, it is a very impressive
majestic piece of architecture, and as there are
several singular anachronisms in the known date of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>{153}</span>
some of the buildings here, it is, of course, possible
that it may be the original building. Waynflete
was greatly attached to Henry VI., who, if the
character that Shakespeare would seem to sketch
of him is reliable, was himself a scholarlike painstaking
man, as far as simple literary ability is concerned.
The high character of Waynflete protected
him in the days of Edward IV., notwithstanding his
attachment to the cause of Henry VI.; he was buried
in great pomp at Winchester in 1486, in a fine
chantry chapel, that is kept in preservation by Magdalen
College.</p>

<p>The entrance gateway, here shown, is a more
characteristic scene of the period of Waynflete.
The architecture is older in character, and the effect
perhaps even better; indeed this is as fine a piece
of architecture for a street corner as any now
existing in England. The interest in Magdalen
College is from its sturdy resistance to James II.
when he decided, as Bishop Burnet quaintly tells
us, to send a mandamus requiring the college authorities
to choose one Farmer for their president,
who had no other qualification except that he had
changed his religion. “Mandamus letters,” the
bishop with simple candour tells us, “had no legal
authority in them, but all the great preferments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>{154}</span></p>

<p class="nind">the church being at the King’s disposal, those who
did pretend to favour were not apt to refuse his
recommendation, lest that should be afterwards remembered
to their prejudice. But now, since it was
visible in what channel favour was likely to run,
less regard was had to such a letter.” This candid
thinker-aloud tells us that one Dr. Hough was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>{155}</span>
every way a suitable man, and one of their body, so

<p>Norfolk and Suffolk were the last counties
visited for the purposes of this present work, and it
is a matter of regret that they cannot occupy so
much space as their extremely interesting remains
demand. Norwich is certainly one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>{156}</span>
interesting cities in England. Formerly the Duke
of Norfolk used to reside here for a part of the year,
in almost regal state, and many houses were built by
the gentry who attended his court. This in a great
measure accounts for the number of fine old
mansions that remain in the city. The ecclesiastics
of Norwich do not seem to have been so amiable as
their brethren of Ely, and many were the disputes
that occurred between them and the citizens. Sometimes
a boundary and sometimes an outrage was the
bone of contention, till on one occasion the monks
killed several citizens who endeavoured to take
possession of a piece of land which the monastery
claimed. An inquest was held, and a verdict of
wilful murder returned against the monks who had
killed them. This seems to have been met
promptly by a sentence of excommunication against
every citizen in Norwich, but as it did not reduce
them to a proper tone of submission, the ecclesiastical
party betook to more carnal weapons, and
secure in their walls they beguiled many an hour
with archery practice at the expense of the citizens.
The chroniclers tell us that the clerical party tired
at last of this desultory warfare, and on the Sunday
before St. Lawrence day (which would be in the
beginning of August) “sallied out, and went in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>{157}</span>
raging manner about the city,” killing and plundering.
They concluded their Sunday’s labours by
breaking open a tavern kept by one Hugh de
Bromholm, drinking all the wine they could, and
turning on the taps before leaving. Of course this
led to further civil war, till the king interfered.</p>

<p>Every visitor to Norwich will remember the fine
Erpingham gateway; it does not figure here
because in a future work I propose to illustrate the
gateways of England, with their history; but briefly
speaking, it may be said to consist of a two-centred
arch, curiously and profusely adorned with figures,
niches, trees, birds, shields, and armorial bearings.
Sir Thomas Erpingham appears to have favoured
the cause of Wycliffe, and been condemned to
prison by the clerical party, though they afterwards
were induced to commute his sentence to a fine
such as would enable them to build this gateway,
and do some other ecclesiastical architecture in the
neighbourhood. He was an old man in Henry V.’s
time, but commanded the archers at the battle of
Agincourt, and gave the signal for the first forward
movement of the English, by throwing his
truncheon high up in the air, and calling out, “Now
strike!” But for his favour with Henry IV. he
would probably have suffered worse than he did at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>{158}</span>
the hands of the Church party, for Spencer, the
bishop of the diocese at that time, declared that he
would make every Lollard hop headless, or else, in
his energetic language, “fry a faggot.” Erpingham’s
loyalty to Bolingbroke’s son is beautifully
suggested in Shakespeare when he enters the tent
where Henry is putting the best face on their
apparently hopeless position to Bedford and
Gloucester&mdash;“There is some soul of goodness in
things evil,” etc.; and the king cheerily addresses
the then aged knight,</p>

passed by till a future series of the present work. The
picturesque bridge called the Abbot’s Bridge forms
the subject of the next illustration; it is one of the
many objects of beauty in Bury, and belonged to
the Abbey at one time. Parliaments were held
here by Henry III., Edward I., and Henry VI.,
and the shrine of St. Edmund was visited by
Henry VII. and his queen, Elizabeth. Dickens
speaks of this place as “the bright little town of
Bury St. Edmund’s.” This structure, of which only
a part is shown, well illustrates the way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>{160}</span>
mediæval architects understood how to design a
bridge, and the same may be said of the one at
Huntingdon. Barry, in an excellent lecture read
before the Royal Academy, remarks that there is no
reason why architecture should suffer from the
abundance of means to compass an end that engineering
has placed in its way: he might have gone
further, and instanced the beautiful works of Telford
or Payne or Rennie. Barry says that old London
Bridge with its narrow pointed arches, and roadway
encumbered with shops, had doubtless a very
picturesque appearance, but even in these days of
revived mediævalism he says they would hardly be
copied. The old bridges, however, were remarkable
for their bridge-like appearance; the piers were free
from columns, and in a running stream they were
exactly suited to resist the flow of water against
them. The old bridge of Huntingdon might stand
for many ages if not molested. The Abbot’s Bridge,
here shown, is a very beautifully proportioned
object, and the piercing of the buttresses gives it an
appearance of lightness. Of course this would not
have been done if any great resisting power were
required against a sudden freshet.</p>

<p>No house is better known perhaps than
Sparrowe’s House, Ipswich, in the old Butter-market<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>{161}</span>.
Formerly this street contained many fine
specimens of old domestic architecture, which have
disappeared, but Sparrowe’s House is not only in
perfect order, it is appreciated and cared for
worthily. This ancient residence consists of four
oriel windows, projecting considerably over the
street, an enormous cornice extends over these
again, and set back in the roof are four gabled
windows. The Sparrowe family have occupied it for
many generations, and although the ornamentations
looked at singly are rather rude and barbaric, the
whole effect is extremely fine. A house still older
than this stood on the site till 1567, when the
present mansion was built, and this is alluded to in
Mr. Cobbold’s <i>Freston Tower</i>. The last member of
the Sparrowe family who lived here was the town-clerk
of Ipswich, and now the building is occupied
by Mr. Haddock, one of the leading provincial
booksellers in that part of England. Here there
is good reason for believing that Charles II. was
concealed after the battle of Worcester. In 1801 a
curiously hidden loft was discovered, the entrance to
which was concealed ingeniously in a panel. Brook
Street, which runs at right angles to the street
where Sparrowe’s House is situated, contains yet the
remains of some old mansions, and in the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>{162}</span>
<i>Freston Tower</i> there is an excellent description of the
appearance of a street in Henry VIII.’s time. In
a passage leading out of St. Nicholas Street, near
St. Nicholas’ Church, there are some traces of the
house where Cardinal Wolsey was born in 1471.
In an admirable Guide to Ipswich, published by
Mr. Vick of that town, it is said, “At the back there
still exists a part of the premises in which the
Cardinal’s father lived. That he was a butcher is
open to doubt; the origin of the assertion being
that he was a man of some property, amongst which
was included the butchers’ shambles.” Farther
down, the streets all bear historic names, such as
Wolsey Street, Cardinal Street, etc. St. Peter’s
Church stands near, and passing by it we enter
College Street, which takes its name from the College
the Cardinal built here. The gateway only remains,
but it is a fine piece of architecture, built of brick,
without stone enrichments, and it can be described
with perfect accuracy. There are two turrets of
octagonal shape on each side, and a bold Tudor
gateway between them. This gateway is surmounted
by a brick label-moulding, and over this
is a coat-of-arms between two brick niches, and over
the niches are eight quatrefoils. Fuller says that
King Henry was offended because the Cardinal set<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>{163}</span>
his armorial bearings above the King’s at the gatehouse,
but this cannot refer to the gatehouse that is
left, as the royal arms are the only ones there.
This gateway resembles Hampton Court in
character very closely, and probably was the work of
the same designer. The College was founded in
the twentieth year of Henry VIII., and dedicated to
the Virgin. Three years after, the Cardinal fell into
disgrace, and the College was razed to the ground.
This is alluded to in the exquisite scene between
Griffith and Queen Katherine&mdash;“Henry VIII.”</p>

<p>Before reverting to the subject of brick architecture,
which Cardinal Wolsey managed so well, we
may refer to a window from a farm-house near
Salisbury, the dressings of which are stone, simply
to show what can be made by a single form ingeniously
managed. The whole design is constructed
out of a single form of light, a rectangle
with an end cut off diagonally, yet even a practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>{164}</span>
draughtsman would be unlikely to succeed in reproducing
the pattern after studying it, and closing the
book for a short time. This is introduced merely to
show what great variety can be made by combination
of a single form; and if two, or at the most
three, moulds of bricks are used, there is literally no
limit to the designer’s materials.</p>

<p>“Bricks, and especially red bricks,” says Mr.
Trollope, “are almost always mentioned with great
disrespect in connection with architecture, so that
when admirers of that noble science hear upon their
travels of a town or church, or indeed of any building
constructed of brick, they say to their drivers,
‘On, on, there is no pleasure or repose for our eyes
there. Do not deposit us in a locality where one
side of the way is glowering with a coarsely ruddy
aspect at an equally ruddy opposite row of houses;
or where a church of the same hue was built some
eighty years ago, whose thin smooth walls and
Venetian east window already droop across our imagination
to the depression of the spirits.’<span class="lftspc">”</span> Bricks,
however, as he justly proceeds to argue, are not only
useful, but a building material for which a deep debt
of gratitude is due. True it is they baffle the skill of
an ordinary architect of modern times, but in the
reign of Henry VIII. they were a favourite medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>{165}</span>
for building. Witness Hampton Court for example,
or Hurstmonceaux, or Charlton Hall in Kent.
Sometimes brick houses are erected entirely of brick,
and at other times they have stone dressings.</p>

<p>Holland House, built in 1607 by Sir Walter
Cope, where many men of genius have congregated,
and Hatfield House, the residence of the Cecils, for
whom it was built in 1611, are more familiar
examples still, though Sutton Place, near Guildford,
is said to be the finest example in England, and is
built of brick entirely without the aid of stone, and
it shows what may be accomplished in this fine
material. “Its doorway is surmounted by a panel
of moulded bricks representing Cupids within enriched
borders, and flanked by small octangular
turrets, entirely covered with tuns in relief&mdash;the
device of the builder, or with his initials. The walls
are occasionally diversified with reticulated patterns
in black bricks, and the string-courses and even
mullions of the windows, also of brick, are ornamented
with richly moulded patterns, in which the
family tun has a conspicuous place. The whole
façade, after having been much diversified by bay
windows and boldly projecting features, is surmounted
by an elaborately decorated parapet and
slender octagonal pinnacles, etc.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>{166}</span></p>

<p>Sutton Place has been beautifully illustrated in
Nash’s <i>Mansions in the Olden Time</i>, and is a
perfect storehouse of instruction for modern architects.</p>

<p>The grammar-school at Hull, now vacant and
crumbling, is another excellent example of brickwork
on a more moderate
scale. The gable and chimney
here shown are well
broken up into light and
shadow, and beautifully proportioned.
The date of the
foundation is 1486, and probably
the portion illustrated
is of nearly the same antiquity.
The whole of this is
brick unassisted by stone,
and even the coping is ingeniously
contrived by one
brick overlapping another. The mullions and window-heads
also are of brick not moulded, but the
ordinary rectangular ones are contrived to answer
all the purposes of the architect.</p>

<p>Mr. Trollope in his admirable paper points out
that Babylon at a very early period practised brick-making,
as did also Assyria and Egypt; whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>{167}</span>
Romans, whose powers of adaptation are yet a
wonder to us, became so enamoured of bricks for constructive
purposes that they used wide bricks in arches
and vaultings, on account of their utility in shaping,
even where stone was plentiful. Indeed bricks have
been used by our Saxon forefathers, as in the church
of Brixworth and elsewhere; and in the twelfth
century the preference seems almost to have been
given to brickwork in many important European
buildings. During the fourteenth century stone
seems to have the preference over brick in England,
though on the Continent many important buildings
were built of the latter material.</p>

<p>The principles which, after comparing many examples
of different dates, seemed to me the true
ones, in order to successfully use bricks, are few and
simple, and it is a great pleasure to find them in
many respects identical with those Mr. Trollope has
laid down in the excellent paper to which this
chapter is so much indebted.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Martel, in his <i>Principles of Colouring</i>, published
by Winsor &amp; Newton, says that in the present state
of our knowledge it is difficult to offer a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>{168}</span>
explanation of the cause of the peculiar colours of
different substances&mdash;that is, why grass is green, or
copper red, or silver white; and he adds that it is
usual to account for them by saying that all bodies
<i>absorb</i> certain colours and reflect others, the colour
absorbed being always complementary to that reflected.
Thus if a body is green it is said to absorb
the red rays, and reflect blue and yellow, and so
with others. He further says that if the eye sees
red it is immediately called up to see another colour,
namely green, which is the exact contrast; and
states that if a red flower is placed on a sheet of
white paper and suddenly withdrawn, a green image
will faintly appear to the eye.</p>

<p>Now a broad red wall is one of the most dreary
objects of modern civilisation, and, indeed, the side
of a square, broken only by rectangular windows, as
exhibited in London squares, has doubtless had a
depressing and injurious effect on the duration of
human life. Russell Square and Bedford Square are
familiar instances of this; and how unfavourably
they contrast with old Lincoln’s Inn buildings, in
the same city, the engraving will show, yet the same
architecture that prevails in Lincoln’s Inn would
abundantly serve all the purposes of a London
square of modern times. The corbelling out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>{169}</span>
chimney, and the way in which the octagon and
gables blend together, is artistic to a passing degree,
and well the designer knew the value of the material
he had in hand. Probably it was erected in the
latter part of Queen Elizabeth’s reign.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">ANCIENT BRICKWORK, LINCOLN’S INN.</span>

<p>Lincoln’s Inn was equal in importance, it is said,
to the Temple, and had its annual revels. The
Temple master of these was a “Lord of Misrule,” till<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>{170}</span>
the better feeling of the members stopped all these
saturnalia. “Assumed characters,” it is said, were
so numerous that they required limitation in the
edicts of the Benchers, and “Jack Straw” and his
train were banished under pain of any one who
assumed the character paying five pounds; and
though Charles II. visited Lincoln’s Inn to see the
revels, they were doomed to disappear.</p>

<p>To return to the subject of brick structures and
the laws that should guide them, the principles of
Martel ought not to be lost sight of, and well
indeed Mr. Trollope seems to have felt them. A
pedestal of stone, as he instances, even if flat, would
not be an eyesore, because the ordinary colours of
stone are not obtrusive, while a pedestal of red brick
without proper relief would be simply intolerable.
The colour of the material requires us to handle it
with more thoughtfulness than stone. Who does
not delight in the red coat of a trooper in one of the
old Dutch pictures, or a red cow in one of Cuyp’s
pieces?</p>

<p>A good architect must be a good artist too in
dealing with this difficult material, and he has to
handle his shadows with skill, and not only so, he
must carry these into as many interstices as possible;
he calls upon nature to aid him with gray shades by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>{171}</span>
bringing some features forward, and deeply recessing
others, and by repeating octangular features as
much as possible, so as to make the most out of the
chances of shadow that are afforded to him. “Knowing
further how ill a straight line of heavy red looks
when forced into contrast with the transparent blue
sky, or even with the fleecy gray clouds above, he
multiplies his gables as far as he consistently can,
and exhibits them where they will most be seen,
raises up his chimney shafts in irregular groups, and
delights to diversify them by a few turrets and
pinnacles, etc., so as to give as much variety and
lightness to his structures as possible.”</p>

<p>The house where Mr. William Wilberforce was
born, in Hull, is a very curious specimen of brickwork,
and differs in every respect from the examples
we have been considering. It seems hardly to be
indigenous, and, perhaps, belongs to a large class of
brick houses that were imported from Flanders;
indeed, the term “Flemish bond,” as applied to the
peculiar style of brickwork that prevailed in
England after the reign of William and Mary,
sufficiently indicates a foreign origin, and now it is
commonly used in specifications of buildings where
it is required, as distinguished from English bond,
and is thoroughly understood by modern workmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a>{172}</span></p>

<p class="nind">Of course there is a limit to the scope in which
bricks may be said to compete with stone for building
purposes. The nature of the material prevents
our having any great projections; they would
require to be supported by iron bands and set in
cement, and be entirely false construction, if not
dangerous, and statuary or sculpture is of course
out of the question in brick. But there is nothing
to prevent deeply recessed openings in windows or
doorways, and many patterns might be repeated,
such as pateræ or cuspings. In all old brickwork
there is no attempt to conceal the nature of the
material, or make it appear to do more than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>{173}</span>
actually does in the building. But brickwork is
capable of being used in tracery in churches when
geometrical work is required, and by splaying the
bricks if necessary a very useful material indeed is
revived.</p>

<p>I wish I could agree with Mr. Trollope’s
admirable paper in his estimate of parti-coloured
bricks; he has given some examples of these which
are quite as good as anything of the kind, but there
is always an unpleasant look about this mode of
decoration. Bricks in contrasted colours cannot
avoid a harlequin appearance; the variety of colours
is always great, and the contrast too strong to be
pleasant. The charming surroundings with which
we may have seen this kind of decoration in foreign
lands often may be the cause of our having a kindly
feeling towards it, but even then we none of us,
probably, have admired it at first. The real point
to aim at in the contrast of colours is the natural
light and shade that octagonal turrets and deep
recesses can afford us. Hurstmonceaux, Tattershall
Castle, Hampton Court, or Lincoln’s Inn, give us all
this in perfection. Moulded bricks might be used
also with great advantage in fireplaces in rooms;
and at a fraction of the expense of the dreary chilly
marble “mantel-pieces,” as they are called, a handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>{174}</span>
pleasing feature might be introduced. It
would not be desirable perhaps to employ white
mortar, for fear of giving an unfinished appearance,
but mortar can be tinted in a hundred ways, and a
chimney-piece of bricks, moulded and square, might
be put up at a cost of £5 or £6, that should far
exceed the peculiar ones that disfigure our town
houses of modern days, at five times the cost.</p>

There is a peculiar interest in the thought that all
has been reclaimed by human labour from the
wilderness. These counties do not present such
insuperable difficulties for cultivation as Holland,
because they are above the level of the sea, and do
not require to be pumped dry like the Low Countries.
The latter, indeed, would be flooded over if human
energy were to cease in protecting them for one
single year. The most curious feature in these vast
dreary flats is the splendour of the ecclesiastical
buildings that rise up above the horizons at great
distances. Peterborough is hardly out of sight before
the towers of Ely appear, vast and gray. The
homesteads on these flats are generally good, for the
farmers, to make amends for their solitude, can
always procure plenty of good land at a comparatively
low rental, and their dwellings have a picturesqueness
of their own among stacks of turf and
stunted orchards. After passing Chittisham, on the
Ely road, all begins to mend&mdash;the land gently rises,
hedgerows reappear, marsh willows give way to
beech and elm, and the towers of Ely stand grandly
out against the sky. The entrance to the close
here shown is a wonderful example of picturesque
beauty; as for architecture, in the modern sense of
the term, it possesses none, but it simply owes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>{177}</span>
pleasing appearance to the quaint combination of its
parts, all of which are plain. There is nothing
whatever to prevent its being adapted to an entrance
for workshops or a builder’s yard, and so
enlivening a dreary street. The only difficulty is in
always being able to find the architect capable of
designing anything so picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>{178}</span></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. J. Petit raises the question of
what constitutes picturesqueness in architecture.
An artist, he says, will instinctively fall into the best
method of treating his picture, and that, he says, is
the way with the best architects; their task either
comes naturally, or is so formed by study as to take
its place, while at work, and the charm of their
designs is that they do not seem to be weighing or
adjusting every little bit of light or shade or projection.
“An architect who thus forms his taste, and
then follows it without too apparent reference to
rule, produces works of far higher merit than one
whose evident aim is either fantastic grouping on
the one side, or conventional correctness on the
other.”</p>

<p>This is, as Mr. Petit remarks, the real charm of
mediæval work; and the reason why our own imitations
of it, clever and careful as they may be, are
seldom satisfactory. We cannot mediævalise our
tastes, the nineteenth century forbids it. “Lords of
Misrule” or “Jesters” would be intolerable in
modern society, and even the revivals of religious
rites and ceremonies can never be quite separated
from a feeling of burlesque, perhaps almost among
those who participate in them. So if we attempt
mediæval architecture, though less difficulties are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>{179}</span>
our way than other essays at revival, we must have
our copy before our eyes&mdash;and our work looks like
a copy too.</p>

<p>The same difficulties never lay in the way of a
revival of the classic styles. In all countries where
this was attempted, great men were found who
could mould their works in harmony with their
prototypes, and they display a genius far beyond
the mere imitator. In fact, the modes of thought of
the Romans of old were more in accordance with
our own than were those of mediæval monks.
Roman laws are yet the models of advanced
European law, and Roman liberty is the father of
our own liberty; and though the fantastic attempts
that prevailed in the reign of the Georges, to
imitate the externals of classic art and literature,
when every illiterate rustic was a Phyllis or a
Corydon, may have reduced the style to contempt,
and cast, as has been said, a discredit upon all classical
architecture, this cannot sully the creations of
such men as Alberti, Michael Angelo, Wren, or
Vanbrugh. In the item of picturesqueness, however,
to which further reference will be made hereafter,
our own mediæval architecture must bear the
palm far away, and the abandon about it makes it
exactly suit our old cities and towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>{180}</span></p>

<p>The Plough Inn at Ely is a fine old specimen of
an English roadside hostelry; it appears to date
back to Henry VIII.’s time. The chimney is peculiarly
bold and striking, and the composition might
very well be adapted to any roadside building of
the present day. The remaining drawing of Ely is
a very noble group of architecture. The College
Chapel occupies the foreground, beyond it is the
Deanery, and above that the Cathedral Tower.
The chapel is splendidly carved inside, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>{181}</span>

Tudor architecture. The chapel here shown appears
to date back to the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Ely fair is a thing of the past, but it used to be a
very picturesque memorial of St. Etheldreda, the saint
to whom the city owed its importance in the first
instance. It commenced at the latter part of October,
on the day that was dedicated to the saint, and
lasted several days. Many-coloured ribbons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>{182}</span>
sold, and called St. Audrey’s ribbons, a corruption of
the saint’s name, and their merit seems to have been
that they had touched her shrine. When we consider
how very isolated Ely was before drainage
had improved the surrounding country, we can
more readily understand how Hereward held it so
long against William the Conqueror, and caused
him so much loss. The monks of Ely were said
to have been at all times noted for their kindness
and hospitality. On one occasion when William
had collected the principal gentry of the neighbourhood
to accompany him on an expedition to
Normandy, he quartered them in the monastery, and
they soon became extremely friendly with the ecclesiastics,
though they were there hardly as invited
guests; but when the time for their departure came,
the monks expressed the deepest regret at losing
their friends, and accompanied them in solemn procession
as far as Hadenham, a village about five
miles distant.</p>

<p>No illustrations have been given of Cambridge,
which is about fourteen miles to the south of Ely,
as the author hopes to be able to produce at some
future time a work of illustrations of that town. In
some respects it is more picturesque even than
Oxford: the quaint old courtyards and entries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a>{183}</span>
the old-fashioned gabled houses, give it a peculiar
charm. The University had a chancellor and
masters many centuries before the charter of incorporation
in 1231, but up to the close of the
thirteenth century it contained no college buildings.
St. Peter’s was the earliest, and that was built by
the Bishop of Ely; and Downing, founded by Sir
George Downing, the latest. The annual income
of the colleges in all is about £185,000.</p>

<p>Near the town of Huntingdon is the beautiful
Hinchinbrooke House. It was built by the
Cromwell family, probably by Sir Henry Cromwell,
the great-uncle of Oliver Cromwell, and Queen
Elizabeth was entertained here by the “Golden
Knight” as he was called. Oliver Cromwell’s
house is still pointed out, and the church of All
Saints contains the register of Cromwell’s birth. It
is in Latin, and an exact translation would read,
“Oliver, son of Robert Cromwell, gentleman, and
Elizabeth, his wife, born on the 25th day of April,
and baptized the 29th of the same month.” Hinchinbrooke
House is a very noble specimen of
baronial architecture, and it must often have been
visited by Oliver Cromwell. There is a description
of Cromwell in the <i>Remains</i> of Sir Philip Warwick
that is not often quoted, and may be interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>{184}</span>
here. At the commencement of the Long Parliament,
he says, “I came one morning into the house
well clad, and perceived a gentleman speaking
(whom I knew not) very ordinarily apparelled; for
it was a plain cloth suit that seemed to have been
made by a country tailor; his linen was plain and
not very clean; and I remember a speck or two of
blood upon his little band which was not much
larger than his collar; his hat was without a hat-band;
his stature was of good size; his sword stuck
close to his side; his countenance swollen and reddish;
his voice sharp and untunable; his eloquence
full of fervour.” The house at the farther end of
Huntingdon where Cromwell once lived is still
pointed out, and the room where he was born is
preserved, but the building itself has been much
modernised, and ordinary sash-windows have been
inserted.</p>

<p>Hinchinbrooke House used to be the residence
of Sir Oliver Cromwell, the uncle of the great Protector,
and it was sold to Sir Edward Montague, in
whose family it has remained till the present day.
There is one magnificent room in it built by Sir
Oliver Cromwell to entertain James I. in, on his
coming from Scotland to succeed to the English
throne. Oliver Cromwell’s mother was Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a>{185}</span>
Stewart, and her brother left him a good estate,
valued at £500 per annum, of course an ample sum
in those days.</p>

<p>Part of the castle which Edward the elder built
here in 917 is still to be seen; traces of the outworks
are very visible. Before the Reformation,
Huntingdon contained fifteen churches, but these
are now reduced to two.</p>

<p>The poet Cowper lived for some time in this
town, and his house is still called “Cowper House.”</p>

<p class="nind">given differs but little from what it did when Oliver
Cromwell saw it. St. Neots is an extremely interesting
old town with a very noble church, which
contains a peal of eight bells, but it is often inundated
by the rising of the Ouse.</p>

<p>Katherine of Arragon, after her divorce from
Henry VIII., resided much in Huntingdonshire;
sometimes at Kimbolton, now the seat of the Duke
of Manchester, and sometimes at Buckden, on the
west side of the Ouse, about five miles from St.
Neots. This is a very interesting little country
town, and the ancient palace of the bishops of
Lincoln (for the Abbot of Ely granted the manor to
the bishops of Lincoln) stands in the middle of the
village. The mansion is beautifully built in brick,
and had been erected about half a century before
the divorce of Queen Katherine. Kimbolton is a
small market town on the Kym, a tributary of the
Ouse, and can of course boast of a fine old church.
The second scene of the fourth act of “Henry VIII.,”
already alluded to, is laid here, where Katherine
hears from her attendants of the death of Wolsey at
Leicester Abbey. Very little is left of Leicester
Abbey; it certainly shows by the foundations that
are left of it what a grand old building it must at
one time have been, but the gardens and park are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>{188}</span></p>

are very comfortable, and the excellently worked
stone that lies about indicates pretty well how carefully
the Abbey had been built. Wolsey had
reached Sheffield Park when he was struck down by
a mortal sickness, and then “by slow and easy
stages came to Leicester.” His last words to Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>{189}</span>
Kingston much resemble his speech in
Shakespeare, where the reverend Abbot</p>

<div class="poetry">

his gracious remembrance all things that have
passed between us from the beginning, especially
respecting Queen Katherine and himself, and then
shall his conscience know whether I have offended
him or not. He is a prince of most royal courage,
and hath a princely heart, for rather than miss
or want any part of his will he will endanger the
one half of his kingdom. And, I do assure you, I
have often kneeled before him in his privy chamber,
sometimes for three hours together, to persuade him
from his appetite, and could not prevail. And,
Master Kingston, this I will say, had I but served
God as diligently as I have served the king, he
would not have given me over in my gray hairs.
Howbeit, this is my just reward for my pains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>{190}</span>

<p>Market Bosworth is twelve miles west of the
county town, and here the last great battle of the
Wars of the Roses was fought. The scene of the
battle was Redmoor plain, nearly two miles from
the town. When the conflict took place, in 1485, it
was a moor grown over with thistles and scutch
grass. King Richard’s army encamped at Elmsthorpe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>{191}</span>
and Stapleton; they numbered some 16,000
men, and his officers made their head-quarters at
Elmsthorpe church. Richmond’s were at Atherstone
in Warwickshire. Here the seceders from
Richard III.’s army met him, and joined their forces
before the decisive battle. The whole tale is
tremendously told in Shakespeare, and the well
where Richard slaked his thirst during the battle is
pointed out on a farm in the neighbourhood. This
place is well worth a visit, and, singularly enough,
the country people are tolerably versed in the
details of the conflict, and are able to point out the
localities with some probable accuracy. The house
where Richmond stayed on his road to Bosworth
has already been engraved in the account of Shrewsbury,
and unhappily the “Blue Boar Inn” at Leicester,
where his stone coffin was used for a drinking-trough
for horses and cattle, has been pulled down;
many persons are able to recollect it, and say it
was picturesque, but I have not yet found a drawing
of it.</p>

<p>Bedford is built on both sides of the Ouse. The
principal street is about a mile in length, and it

<p class="nind">the jail where Bunyan was imprisoned.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This jail
was the first to excite the interest and compassion of
Howard. Near Bedford is the picturesque village
of Elstow, where Bunyan was born; the house is
pointed out, though it has been refronted. Bunyan
took the side of Cromwell in the civil wars, and his
escape from death at the siege of Leicester is well
known; we are indebted to his incarceration for what
Macaulay declares to be incomparably the finest
allegory in our language. There are several
drawings of the jail preserved, and nothing could be
more picturesque: there are projecting roofs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a>{193}</span>
overhanging storeys, and apparently a quaintly-tiled
roof of different levels. A flat archway spanned the
bridge, and there was a sundial over it. Such gatehouses
were not at all uncommon, and they were
often used afterwards for prisons.</p>

<p>The bridge over the Dee, leading from the
Wrexham road to Chester at Handbridge, had two
similar gatehouses, but, from drawings that have
been preserved of them, they must have been
immeasurably more picturesque: one of them was
gabled, and covered with tiles similar to those that
are common in Holland, and the other had a portcullis
and bastions, and a fine tower four storeys
high, in which was a large clock. Unfortunately,
these were all demolished in 1782, and a new gate
called Bridgegate, a rather unsightly structure,
given to us instead.</p>

<p>In a drawing by Randal Holme, made about the
middle of the seventeenth century, in which these
gates are shown, are some curious water-mills. It is
difficult to form any very definite idea of the way in
which they are worked, or what their general appearance
may have been, but the wheels seem to have
stood out from the sides not dissimilarly to the
paddles of a steamer, and probably could be lowered
or heightened according to the level of the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>{194}</span></p>

<p>Ruskin has said that picturesque beauty cannot
exist with any manufacturing district where coal is
the propelling power. The requirements of such a
condition effectually prevent it; but what would be
the saving, not only to the picturesque character of
the landscape, but the purses of millowners, if water
power was more commonly taken advantage of! It
has long been a crying reproach to the country that
all round our coasts, and in our inland streams,
water-power exists that would drive all the machines
in the world without exhausting a tithe of its force,
or even beginning to do so. This power also is ever
at hand, a ready servant, wanting no fee, depending
on no forced prices from colliers, and leaving the
atmosphere it works in healthy and bright. In one
mill alone I know of, a saving of £5000 per annum
could be effected by using water-power, and yet this
power is flowing by the doors of the establishment;
but coal was used sixty years ago, and things have
prospered, so why try to mend what is well? Not
only would water be a great economiser in works
where force is necessary, but it might be a great
social reformer, and this is quite in concert with the
opinions of scientific men who have given the subject
their study. The acrid nature of an atmosphere
among chimneys is depressing and exhausting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a>{195}</span>
is often&mdash;too often&mdash;counteracted by a remedy
which might be less imperative if water-power were
used,&mdash;a remedy too, indeed, in which water does
not play a very important part. The science of
economy in water-power is increasing continually;
indeed, it can by turbine wheels be used and re-used
so often that a small stream might become a mighty
engine, and the saving in coal be placed to the
credit of the housekeeper. Every one knows this
well, but there seems to be a general dislike to put
the knowledge they possess into practice; and though
it may be hardly in the scope of the present work
to make the remark, there can be no doubt that the
sudden and high rise in the price of coals has
taught the value of economy in that article, much to
the advantage of the exteriors and interiors of our
streets and homesteads.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman conquest Lincoln
was one of the wealthiest and most populous cities
in England. It has passed through many rulers,
and its commanding situation has always marked it
out for a place of importance. It was a city of the
ancient Britons before the Roman period, and the
Romans built a wall round it with posterns. One of
these, Newport Gate, yet remains, and is a model
of massive masonry. The stones are cut to a radius<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>{196}</span>
to form the arch, and are extremely massive and
strong. The arch appears to have been built without
mortar, and was the portal of the celebrated
Ermine Street, which is described in page 248. It
is a very pleasant entrance to the city from the
north. There are some good trees about it, and
the Cathedral towers rise high above it, while
several antique gables of neighbouring houses give
it a very picturesque effect. Lindum was the name
the Romans gave it, and some derive its present
name (<i>Lindum-colonia</i>) from this. The Roman wall,
of which there are many traces, was quadrangular.</p>

<p>In few cities in England can ancient street
architecture be better studied than in Lincoln.
There are not only traces of Roman work, with
baths and many other remains, but the Normans
have left their mark here also, as have many of
the Kings of more recent date.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the beauty of Lincoln as it
is approached from the south, and nearly every step
unfolds some grand picture that differs from the
last. There is a sort of harbour on the Witham, at
the south end of the city, which is generally pretty
well filled with picturesque barges, and the sails of
these, red and white, reflected in the water, are at all
times extremely pleasant to see. A small island<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>{197}</span>
covered with willows is in this harbour, and the city
rises grandly above it, crowned at the top by the
full length of the cathedral. The only cathedral
that can compare with Lincoln for situation is
Durham. As we enter the city from this point we
soon come to the Stone Bow, a very stately gateway
crossing the street, and finely carved towards
the south side. There seems to be some little
uncertainty about the date and origin of this
structure; some accounts assert that it was built in
1592. This is, however, obviously incorrect, and
Britton attributes it to the reign of Henry VIII.
With all respect, however, for such an authority, it
would seem to be rather older than this. A French
style of ornament often appeared in England in the
reign of Henry VI., and something very similar to
this may be noticed on the arch.</p>

<p>The view here given is after the archway has
been passed some little distance, and the scene
alters. The house on the left is the celebrated
Jews’ house that has so often figured in song and
fable. This is a fine specimen of a Norman town
residence, the most perfect specimen in fact that
we have left. It is built of stone, and not wood as
many of the houses of that period were, and until
lately there were numbers of immense beams in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>{198}</span>
the recesses of Lincoln streets hidden away in cellars
and back premises that dated to the Norman period.
Indeed some few parts of wooden fronts also that
have been swept away by improvement.</p>

<p>Winwall House is detached, and dates back to
the same age as the Jews’ house. It is much less
elaborately carved, but the two form the most complete
picture that is left us of Norman domestic
architecture. Winwall should have appeared in
these pages, but Britton has engraved it well in his
fifth volume of <i>Architectural Antiquities</i>, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>{199}</span>
sketch by the late G. Cattermole, and as this volume
is not found in every library I venture to quote
some extracts as illustrating the accommodation of a
Norman mansion.</p>

<p>“Winwall House,” says Britton, “may be considered
the most ancient and most perfect specimen
of Norman domestic architecture in the kingdom.
I visited it with the Rev. Mr. Forby, a well-informed
antiquary, about ten years ago. It must suffice to
remark that the walls, the buttresses, with cylindrical
shafts at the angles, the form and situation of
fire-hearth and chimney-piece, the moulding and
angular columns, are all indicative of Norman
design. The ground-floor is entered by a small
doorway on the south side, and lighted by three
windows,” etc. etc. Britton then mentions that a
thick partition wall cuts off a chamber which some
have supposed to be a chapel, though Britton doubts
it; but the most suggestive part of this house is its
size and importance, and, if this is borne in mind,
many things we come across in history will be more
readily understood. The total length of Winwall
House is 35 feet, about the frontage of a small semi-detached
villa, and its breadth 27 feet; from this
walls of 3 feet in thickness must be deducted, and
then we shall have some idea of its small size. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>{200}</span>
William the Conqueror granted the manor of Wereham,
of which this forms a part, to one of his followers,
who sold it to the Earl of Clare, or from
whom, at any rate, it passed to that family, and we
find that the Earl of Clare in King John’s reign
held a court here. There is little wonder that great
baronial castles might take the place of such houses
where there was so much insecurity, in the same way
that a great landowner will sometimes absorb cottage
holdings into a larger farm, to the mutual advantage
of every one on his estate. Remembering the size
of this manor-house, we can the more easily understand
how it is that chroniclers state that, in order
to clear the ground for Lincoln Castle, 166 mansions
were destroyed, and furthermore, in order to give
this castle the advantage of standing alone, 74 more
were also demolished, yet this is on the authority of
Domesday Book.</p>

<p>Lincoln Castle yet retains externally many of
its ancient features, disfigured, probably, and dilapidated,
but yet presenting the general appearance of
a Norman fortress of the first class. “Its plan,” says
Britton, “was accommodated to the area selected for
its site, which comprehends the south-west quarter
of the Roman city, consequently it approaches to a
quadrangular figure, though not one of its sides is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>{201}</span>
strictly regular. There are two principal entrances,
one opening to the town towards the east, the
other to the fields on the west; and it is worthy of
notice that neither of these gates is placed opposite
to the middle of the area, nor do they stand in a line
facing each other, but one is set near the southeastern
corner of the castle, the other to the northwestern
one. The mode of placing the gates was
probably contrived for strength; or it might be
connected with some internal divisions that cannot
now be traced. The eastern gate is the one now
made use of. Its original architecture is covered by
a pointed arch and turrets, probably erected in the
reign of Edward III.” The other gate to the castle
has often been supposed by old antiquaries to be one
of the Roman gates utilised for the purposes of the
castle, but this can hardly be substantiated, as the
portcullis grooves and other mediæval traces can be
detected.</p>

<p>Nothing more clearly shows the absorbing nature
of the feudal system than these old castles; they
were in fact often, as one might say, villages in
themselves; but we are left much in the dark as to
the way in which they were supported. Tribute was
exacted in the form of produce and labour, but
money must have been very scarce, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>{202}</span>
it is impossible to estimate the relative value of
money now and in those days. The common estimates
of ten to one or twenty to one break hopelessly
down the moment they are tried by known
criteria; indeed, there is not a little discrepancy
between these two favourite estimates themselves,
without going much further. Some of the commonest
necessaries of life are even cheaper now than they
were then, such as books, or cloth, or travelling, or
elaborate iron work, where, at least, cast-iron may
be said to stand in place of wrought; but, again,
other things, especially labour, are probably so much
dearer now, that all kinds of comparison are useless.
The remuneration of a first class professional man
would be often inadequately stated if pounds were
put for pence, and labour differed astonishingly in
every part of England. Even now, when we consider
that in domestic servants’ wages we find a difference
amounting to perhaps 100 per cent in various parts
of England, what must that have been in those
days?</p>

<p>If, as is stated, Gundulph, the bishop of
Rochester, built the keep of Rochester Castle at a
cost of sixty pounds&mdash;and if this is true, quite as
remarkable things are on record&mdash;it is clearly hopeless
to attempt to reconcile any known money value<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>{203}</span>
of things with prices we are familiar with. Even
if the amounts paid to great dignitaries were to be
assessed according to any scale that has been
named, they would be ridiculous, and yet that would
seem to be the most natural and neutral test. If
the Lord Chief-Justice of England were now offered
in the way of fee for his annual labours ten or even
twenty times the value of the sum that was paid to
Chief-Justice Gascoigne in Henry IV.’s time, he
would probably look quite as severely as that judge
ever did on the Prince of Wales; so that, when we say
the forfeited estates of a monastery, or the rent-roll
of a nobleman, were say £500 a year, it is entirely
beside the question to attempt to arrive at the value
by any rough-and-ready method of multiplication.
Perhaps most of this was paid in kind, and very
little gold passed, and great allowance must be made
for isolation. Of course, leaving railways on one
side, we must remember what the state of roads
was before the present century. Certainly, when
ecclesiastical architecture was in its glory in England,
a journey from Liverpool to London would
have entailed as much manual labour as from London
to Calcutta for each traveller, and this is very much
within the mark. In many counties in England
£10 in those days would represent £500 now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>{204}</span>
in some, of course, the difference would be much
less striking. This is introduced here, because, unless
such variations are kept in mind, we shall always
be at fault in trying to arrive at any comparative
estimate of the value of money, and be continually
led astray in assessing the nominal rent-rolls of
abbeys or manors.</p>

<p>Near the spot where the view of the Jews’
House is taken stands the conduit, a small pretty
little building like a chapel, that in all probability
was constructed out of the spoils of some ecclesiastical
remain. Leland describes it as newly built
when he saw it about the middle of the sixteenth
century; and as the ornaments, such as the cuspings
and other enrichments, belong to a period of some
two centuries earlier, this is probably its history. Then
as the convent of the Carmelites or White Friars
stood on the opposite side of the street, the materials
most probably came from there. Some of these
conduits still remain in England, and are in use at
the present day; and when we remember that only
two centuries ago they formed the principal means
of supplying water to the citizens, our march of improvement
does indeed seem wonderful. The
amount now considered necessary for the health and
comfort of a city is at least twenty-five gallons per<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a>{205}</span>
diem for each person, and, even with rain water, we
may judge how far short the mediæval supply must
have been.</p>

<p>As we ascend the hill the road becomes steeper,
and we wind through the remains of the bishop’s
palace, which are very grand, now broken into picturesque
fragments and shrouded with ivy. The
next scene is on the Witham as it runs through
Lincoln, and wonderfully picturesque it is. The
archway is of great antiquity. There is a strange
resemblance to some of the Rotterdam scenes in
this, the “vulgar Venice,” as Hood called it, hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206"></a>{206}</span>
with strict justice, even though there may be a vein
of truth in the simile.</p>

<p>In Camden’s work, edited by Gough, it is stated
that the original magnificence of Lincoln may be
gathered from the circumstance that so many
Norman doorways and other splendid architectural
remains (he says Norman and <i>Saxon</i>) are to be
found in Lincoln. Every street, he states, contains
some, and he says that few private dwellings have
not some trace of Norman architecture inside or
outside. Certainly this statement is from Camden,
but it passes without challenge in Gough’s edition,
and Gough died in the year 1809, though then
advanced in years.</p>

<p>There is a house in Lincoln called John of
Gaunt’s Stables, but it is said that it ought more
properly to be called his palace, and whether it was
his or not seems by some persons to be disputed;
one thing, however, is certain, it is an extremely
valuable relic, and, though it is in a shocking state
of neglect, the rooms may be easily traced. “Fronting
the street we have a round archway that immediately
arrests attention, a very fine one of the
period. The upper storey is gone, that contained the
chief apartments; the lower is only lighted by
loopholes, as usual; we pass under the archway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>{207}</span>
and in its sullen shade dungeon-like portals appear
on each side. But the archway admits us to a
quadrangle or square court, round the sides of which
are hidden, as it were, the stables, a sort of long,
low, vaulted, and pillared hall, and the various
offices, all of a gloomy confined character, that belonged
to such an establishment. It has been
thought that the idea of such specimens of domestic
architecture might be improved in our palaces, that
of concealing all the miscellaneous rooms round
enclosed courtyards, and placing the principal apartments
connectedly on one grand storey over the
ground-floor, and thus the custom, originally
prompted by danger, might be made, with modification,
to promote harmony and convenience.”
The account just quoted says, “Another feature in
the Norman residences was the movable staircase
on the outside of the house.” This is even yet
continued in some of the old farms in Cheshire. I
have seen the labourers go to their loft to sleep, and
the farmer remove the staircase regularly each
night. Surely the necessity for such a precaution has
long passed away, as now labourers may rest as
securely in any part of England as if they were in
barracks. This custom, however, I have repeatedly
seen, certainly within the last twenty years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>{208}</span></p>

<p>Another palace, said to be John of Gaunt’s, is
still remaining at Gainsborough, in this county. It
is used as a corn exchange, assembly rooms,
mechanics’ institute, and part of it is a spacious
smithy. There is a large amount of “post and
petrel” work, as it is called, or oak and plaster, but
there is also some magnificent brickwork, which of
course in every way fulfils the requirements of
design already spoken of for this material. The
octagonal tower, of brick, is beautifully designed,
and indeed the enormous buildings bristle over with
nearly every kind of device to please. The window,
which forms a tailpiece to this chapter, is a splendid
piece of work, but evidently rather later than John
of Gaunt. This quiet old country town, that is
nothing but an agricultural mart now, has seen some
stirring times. Sweyne, the King of Denmark, sailed
up the Humber and Trent, and landed at Gainsborough,
remaining in the neighbourhood for two
years, and only being bribed with difficulty to go
away; nor did the marauders remain more than one
year absent. Alfred the Great was married here in
868; and in 1643 Cromwell routed the Royalists
under the command of General Cavendish, the
brother of the Duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p>Stamford is a town of great antiquity, and is
situated on the Welland; its south side reaches over
the border into Northampton. The name is said to
be derived from “Stean-forde,” as the ford which
crossed the Welland here was paved with stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>{210}</span>
Stamford was the meeting place of several parliaments
in the fourteenth century, and there were no
less than five monasteries there. Gables figure in
great variety and shapeliness here, and afford many
studies for an architect. The streets are irregular,
but well paved and very clean, and the town
reminds one generally of an old city on the Rhine;
quaint fronts crowd each other down to the water’s
edge, and the red-tiled roofs break through in pleasing
variety. These are reflected in the river, and interspersed
with trees and gardens.</p>

<p class="nind">beginning to fall, in January, and right well Dickens
has hit off the description of a snow-storm in those
regions. “The night and the snow came on together,
and dismal enough they were. There was no
sound to be heard but the howling of the wind, for
the noise of the wheels and the tread of the horses’
feet were rendered inaudible by the thick coating of
snow which covered the earth, and was fast increasing
every moment. The streets of Stamford were
deserted as they passed through the town, and its
old churches rose dark and frowning from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>{212}</span>
whitened ground.” The George Inn, here given, is
a good example of an excellent old hostelry, and the
signboard across the street is very characteristic of
some of the older inns. “Twenty miles farther
on” Dickens says, “two of the front outside passengers,
wisely availing themselves of their arrival
at one of the best inns in England, turned in for the
night at the George at Grantham.”</p>

<p>The Romans, during their tenure of the island,
constructed dykes, one of which in part remains
at Wainfleet. The car-dyke, also a canal sixty

extending from the Witham to the Trent, are the
works of Roman hands.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire is celebrated for the number and
grandeur of its ecclesiastical remains. Every one
is familiar with the celebrated Croyland Bridge,
built, it is said, long before the Conquest; this is
triangular in form, and the arches meet at the
centre, but the style of building points to a somewhat
later date than tradition ascribes to it. Croyland
is situated in one of the dreariest spots in
England, and, excepting the bridge, has nothing of
interest.</p>

<p>Boston was at one time second only to London<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a>{214}</span>
itself in commercial importance, and in the reign of
Edward III. it was made a staple port for wool, tin,
lead, and other commodities. A staple town, from
which the word staple is derived, was a town fixed
by authority and privilege, to which merchants of
foreign countries brought their ventures&mdash;cloth or
manufactures&mdash;and they were either sold or bartered
away for English goods or produce. The celebrated
church of Boston is dedicated to St. Botolph,
and the name Boston is said to be a corruption of
St. Botolph, a Saxon saint, who established a
monastery here. The tower of Boston church is
nearly 300 feet high, and can be seen at a great
distance either by land or sea. From its blunt
appearance it is familiarly called “Boston stump.”</p>

<p>Oakham is a quiet old country town, in the
middle of an agricultural district, and it contains
many highly respectable houses, inhabited by local
gentry. The market-place is here shown, and the
covered market is built of strong oak. There is
another old oak market in the town, of very singular
construction; it is octagonal, and is supported on
strong oak uprights; the roof rises to a point, and is
shingled strongly with oak. This second market-place,
over which the great church spire rises, is
extremely picturesque, and on market days it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>{215}</span>
form a splendid subject for an artist’s brush. There
is a singular custom at Oakham: every peer of the
realm, on first passing through the town, has either
to pay a fine, or else present the town with a shoe
from his horse; the shoe is then nailed up on the
castle gate, or in some conspicuous part of the
building. Queen Elizabeth has left a memento of
this nature behind her, as also have George IV. and
her present Majesty. These shoes are often gilt
and stamped with the name of the donor and his
arms. The scene here given is taken from the
windows of the Crown Hotel, and is very characteristic
of the place.</p>

<p>Uppingham is a clean neat market town, to
which a railroad has not as yet penetrated. It
consists principally of one long street, nearly at the
middle of which is a large square used for markets.
There is a fine old grammar school here, founded by
the Rev. Robert Johnson, archdeacon of Leicester,
in 1584; he also founded one at Oakham, and
became rector of North Luffenham in this county,
where he died and was buried in 1616. The
property with which he endowed it has increased in
value enormously, and the funds are very large.

Sherwood Forest, is a fine old country town, and
still bears many traces of its ancient importance,
though it has been much modernised. Sherwood
Forest is the most celebrated feature in Nottinghamshire,
and one of the most romantic parts of England.
It is estimated to have been some twenty-five
miles in length, and nearly eight broad in the times
of Robin Hood, who would thus have about two
hundred square miles to roam about in and kill
deer. This popular outlaw has found a warm
advocate across the channel in the person of Mons.
Thierry, who recognises in him a sort of embodyment
of popular feeling that existed against the
singular severity of the Norman forest laws. There
were at one time, it is said, over sixty Royal forests
in England, all protected by laws of great cruelty.
The celebrated Greendale Oak in Welbeck Park was
quite a venerable tree in Robin Hood’s time. There
is a coach road now through its stem. The “Parliament
Oak,” in Clipstone Park, is so called because
tradition asserts that King Edward I. called a
parliament beneath its boughs. “The ancient date,”
says Mr. Major, “may be illustrated by the fact,
that when some of these trees were cut down at the
latter end of the last century, letters denoting the
king’s reign in which they were thus marked, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a>{219}</span>
found stamped on them. One of these, eighteen
inches beneath the surface of the tree, when it was
felled in 1791, and more than a foot from the centre
of the tree, bore the letters showing it had been
marked in the reign of John (<small>A.D.</small> 1199); and
allowing that it was a hundred years old when it
was thus marked, it must have weathered seven
centuries. This is probably the age of the oldest
yet standing in the numerous parks, which still
attest the dimensions of the good old forest of
Sherwood.”</p>

<p>Though it would be rather straining the point
to allude to them as the homesteads which it is
the object of this work to delineate, a passing
mention may be made of the caves with which
this part of England abounded, and which made
such safe retreats for outlaws in those days. Many
of these are of natural formation, either owing to
the porous yielding limestone being eroded by
water, or to the rock commonly called “pudding-stone”
being disintegrated. Some are artificial, as
the one called “Robin Hood’s Stable,” which is,
however, more like a chapel, and probably has
served as one. Sherwood Forest has for generations
been yielding to the axe and the plough,
though a goodly number of the old trees yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>{220}</span>
remain. The trunks, which are found bedded in
the ground, induced a very intelligent writer to say
that it had once before been levelled for cultivation,
but this is probably not the case, for those who
could fell a tree would know its value for domestic
uses. Camden gives the clue to these relics. “It
was anciently thick set with trees, whose entangled
branches were so thickly twisted together that they
hardly left room for a single person to pass,” and
such a state of vegetation is soon fatal to the growth
of large trees. Many American forests are similar
to the Sherwood that Camden describes; the writer
has not unfrequently heard the crash of some tall
forest tree, whose roots were strangled and starved;
indeed a traveller is often surprised, on entering
some grand-looking wood, either in Canada or the
States, to find it paved with huge trunks between
which a more recent growth appeared. Such a
place, with its caverns and its vast extent, might
easily enable a freebooter and his bands to set
authority at defiance, especially when his followers
were desperate men, often flying from the mutilation
or death they had subjected themselves to by
breaking the forest laws; nor were the exploits of
these bands confined to the limits of Sherwood. We
find Robin Hood turning up in Derby and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221"></a>{221}</span>
Yorkshire: a bay there yet bears his name. As
an instance of the way in which a forest may disappear,
might be mentioned the celebrated Wirral
Forest in Cheshire, occupying at one time the
dreary promontory between the Dee and the
Mersey. Now hardly a bush can be induced to grow
here, but at one time it was so thickly wooded
that there was an old saying</p>

<p>But Sherwood is not the only interesting part of
Nottingham historically. The market town of
Southwell, about fourteen miles from the county
town, was the scene of the final surrender of
Charles I. to the Parliamentary forces. This event
occurred at the Saracen’s Head, a fine old-fashioned
hostelry, built at various times: some parts of it
appear to be of Henry IV.’s time, though they have
been called more ancient. This is still the principal
hotel in the town. Shilton, in his History of Southwell,
says, “On the 26th March 1646, Montreville,
the French King’s ambassador, arrived at this inn,
where he lodged till Charles the First could make
his escape from Oxford, which he did as the servant
of, and with, Lord Ashburnham, and arrived at the
inn on the 4th of May following; and Montreville<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222"></a>{222}</span>
having occupied the above room, which was then
divided into a dining-room and bed-room, gave it up
to the King. The next day the King sent for the
Scotch Commissioners (who occupied the palace)
before dinner, and dined with them at this inn.
Here he gave himself up to them, and in the afternoon
went under an escort of their army to
Kelham; both rooms are now thrown into one; the
line of separation is easily discernible on the ceiling,
and the whole of the walls are now covered with
the identical wainscot extant at the time.”</p>

<p>The palace here alluded
to was frequently
the residence of the Archbishops
of York, and is a
splendid ruin. The architecture
principally appears
to be of the latter
part of the fifteenth century,
and the proportions
and mouldings of the
windows are remarkably
graceful and rich. The
chimney here given is
a valuable example for
modern imitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a>{223}</span></p>

<p>Though the closing scene of Charles I.’s liberty took
place at the Saracen’s Head, he was often a
sojourner at the palace. The portion shown here is
part of a homestead, which, with other remains of
the palace, group exceedingly well in combination
with the great minster. The beautiful minster, of
which the tower is shown, is so called from the
South Well, which was a place of pilgrimage in the
middle ages. There were other wells near here,
such as the Lady’s Well, which has been filled up in
consequence of a clergyman being drowned in it
one dark night, and St. Catherine’s Well, still famed
for rheumatic cures.</p>

<p>The chimneys in Southwell Palace are very fine.
Those shown in the next illustration are all of brick,
and somewhat peculiar in construction. They are, in
a sense, octagonal, but simply the angles are taken
off, courses of bricks project at the top, and there is
a slight battlement, which might either be made in
moulded bricks or ordinary ones. These chimneys
are very striking and happy in their effect, and
might, without much expense, be reproduced.
There is, indeed, much more scope in brick chimneys
than in stone and terra-cotta. The latter
always are open to exception, and are tame, while
stone ones, which we see in perfection at such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224"></a>{224}</span>
places at Helmingham or Hinchinbrooke, are costly;
but brick chimneys may be made of a hundred
forms, and that with economy. Homestead and
all as the palace is now, there is singular dignity
in the remains. The windows are peculiarly rich
in mouldings, and, though late in style, they are
extremely beautiful.</p>

<p>Southwell was the place that monarchs and nobles
almost vied with each other in endeavouring to
endow. All the land near it would seem to have
lapsed to the ecclesiastical commissioners, showing
its great possessions, and there were a great number
of resident dignitaries who drew great emoluments
long after their (at any time) nominal duties had
ceased. Two singular discoveries of bodies were
made at this palace&mdash;one in a cloth of silver tissue,
with leather boots on, a wand by its side, and on
the breast something like a silver cup, with an acorn
or bunch of leaves at the top; and the other skeleton
was found in the vault of the palace, here shown,
in an upright position, with an axe-blade in a cleft of
the skull.</p>

<p>Newark is situated on a branch of the Trent,
and is famous in history for its castle, where John
died after his army was swamped in the Wash and
he had reached Swineshead Abbey with great difficulty.
The scene here given is of a lane leading
from the great market square to the close round
St. Mary Magdalen’s Church, and is very characteristic
of an old English town. The roof of the
house seems very high to our modern ideas, and

low. Between the house with the high roof and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a>{226}</span></p>

<p class="nind">gabled house on the left hand there is an alley that
is hardly like any I remember to have seen in
England before. The houses on each side have
projecting storeys, and a projecting eaves to the
roof, and so narrow is it that at one part it is quite
closed overhead, and the rain-water from the higher
house discharges itself, if the gutter is full, upon the
tiles of its opposite neighbour. The church, which
is seen through the opening, is said to be one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a>{227}</span>
finest parish churches in England. There is a
strange piece of street architecture on the road
leading from the station to the town: among other
detached houses is a fine specimen of Queen Anne’s
reign, of fair size and highly enriched, that has been
inhabited for generations by the same family; and
behind it is a beautiful miniature park with every
accessory, including even deer, yet in passing along
the street nothing is seen of this.</p>

<p>Newark Castle is an extremely picturesque ruin,
almost rising on one side out of the river, and on
the other is the cattle-market. It seems to have
departed in a measure from the old rule that made
such places merely fortresses, for there are many
windows of great beauty and justness of proportion,
though most of them belong to a later date than the
original construction. The castle, of course <i>new
work</i>, gave the name to the town, and was built by
the celebrated Bishop Alexander, who had a passion
for castle-building, and does not seem to have endeavoured
to check it in any degree. Perhaps it
was one of the 1100 castles that are said to have
been built in the reign of King Stephen, though the
precise period of his reign cannot exactly be said
to have been strictly adhered to in the estimate.
Some of the work in this castle is as recent, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a>{228}</span>
to all appearances, as Henry VII., and there is
a beautifully corbelled oriel adjoining a window of
this period that dates to the early part of the fifteenth
century. A stranger in Newark will hardly fail to
be struck with the number of signs that still remain;
they are used to distinguish shops, and are hung out
in the same manner as public-house signs are in
other places. In the civil wars Newark Castle
held out very steadily against the Parliamentary
armies, and twice successfully resisted Cromwell’s
forces. Indeed it was only when Charles himself
surrendered to the Scotch Commissioners, and told
them to surrender to the adversaries, that the gallant
defenders gave the castle up to destruction.</p>

<p>The town of Nottingham is about sixteen miles
from Newark; between the two are no considerable
towns or villages of interest. A Roman road goes
nearly the whole distance, only branching off at
Bingham, or rather the Roman road proceeds south,
and that to Nottingham branches to the west:
many armies have passed along it, on all possible
causes, the last being Cromwell’s. In the revolution
of 1688, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord Howe,
and other noblemen, sounded the disposition of the
people of Nottingham by mustering along the road
with some 500 horse, and suddenly sounding to
arms, saying that James II. was within four miles
of the town; whereupon “the whole town was in
alarm; multitudes who had horses mounted and
accoutred themselves with such arms as they had,
whilst others appeared in vast numbers on foot,
some with firelocks, some with swords, some with
other weapons, even pitchforks not excepted, and
being told of the necessity of securing the passage
of the Trent, they immediately withdrew all the
boats that were then at hand to the north side of
the river, and with them and some timber and
barrels in the wharf, and all the frames of the
market stalls, they raised a strong barricade.”
Well pleased with this, Lord Howe and the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230"></a>{230}</span>
Devonshire communicated the subject to the prince,
and at the old market cross, now pulled down, many
people on the following Saturday proclaimed their
danger, and enlisted a troop.</p>

<p>Warwickshire is justly noted for the number and
richness of its mediæval remains. Warwick Castle
and Kenilworth are objects of pilgrimage from all
parts of England, and when the former was partially
burned down in 1871, a national subscription was
raised to restore it. It is one of the few castles
still preserved in something of its original condition,
and inhabited. The state-rooms were saved, but
immense loss was sustained by the fire. Kenilworth
must have been even a more magnificent seat
in its time, and part of it would seem to date back
to Henry I.’s reign. These are buildings, however,
that have plenty of chroniclers, and are noticed in
passing here to indicate, as it were, what a prospect
the county affords of such more humble remains as
were sure to accompany these baronial piles.
There are many such in Warwick. The building
here engraved is Leicester Hospital, founded by the
lord of Kenilworth. It came into possession of
the Dudleys in 1571, and Robert Dudley obtained
an act of incorporation for it, and constituted it
collegiate, converting it into an hospital for a master<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231"></a>{231}</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption">LORD LEICESTER’S HOSPITAL, WARWICK.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">and twelve brethren. The master was to belong to
the Established Church, and the brethren were to
be retainers of the Earl of Leicester and his heirs.
Especial preference was to be given to those who
had been wounded in the wars. The act of incorporation
also gives a list of towns and villages, and
specifies that Queen’s soldiers from these, in rotation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232"></a>{232}</span>
are to have the next presentations. There is a
common kitchen, with cook and porter, etc., and each
brother receives some £80 per annum besides the
privileges of the house. He is obliged to wear a
blue cloth gown, with the bear and ragged staff in
silver. Hardly any more favourable specimen of
street architecture could be found than this fine old
pile. The chapel, which has been restored in
nearly the old form, stretches over the pathway, and
there is a promenade at the top of the flight of
steps round it. The black-and-white gabled building
that forms the hospital is peculiarly beautiful, and the
carvings on it are very fine. There is a spacious
open quadrangle round which the buildings run;
and the galleries and covered stair are models of
picturesqueness and beauty.</p>

<p>Passing through the arched gateway, we come to
the fine old porch attached to the decayed hostelry,
the “Malt Shovel.” It is extremely quaint, and the
bow window in the projection is a very characteristic
feature. Many are the relics in the town of
Warwick itself that would suit the present work.
One here given is a very curious instance of the
way in which an acute-angled street may be made
to contain rectangular rooms, on an upper storey.
This is remarkably beautiful, and of almost puzzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233"></a>{233}</span></p>

<p class="nind">simplicity. It can only be explained in some such
a manner as this. Draw an acute angle&mdash;say
something a little less than a right angle&mdash;and cut
it into compartments; or, if preferred, an obtuse
angle, and cut this into compartments also. Now
the roadway may be so prescribed as to prevent
right angles from being made on the basement, but
the complementary angles are ingeniously made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234"></a>{234}</span>
out by allowing the joists to be of extra length
and cutting the ends off when they come to the
square. The effect is extremely picturesque, and
I cannot remember seeing this peculiar piece of
construction elsewhere. The villages of Warwickshire
are generally remarkable for their picturesque
beauty. Meriden, near Polesworth, is extremely
fine, and from its churchyard are some very beautiful
views.</p>

<p>Merivale Hall is the seat of the Dugdale family.
Sir William Dugdale inherited the estates in 1624,
and published his celebrated <i>Monasticon</i> between

knowledge of the subject since this marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235"></a>{235}</span>

<p>Coventry is a very ancient city. A convent was

a few years before the Norman conquest, and in it
they both were buried. To quote a summary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a>{236}</span></p>

<span class="caption">COVENTRY, WARWICK.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">city history from a careful writer: “Henry IV. held
a parliament here called the unlearned, or Layman’s
Parliament, from the forbidding in the writs of the
return of lawyers, and from the stringent laws that
were passed relative to the privileges of the Church.
Henry V., when Prince of Wales, was committed to
prison by the Mayor of Coventry for his disorderly
conduct here on one occasion. Henry VI. and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237"></a>{237}</span>
Queen, Margaret, were great benefactors to the city;
and its inhabitants remained faithful to the cause of
Lancaster during the dreadful period of the Wars of
the Roses.” Henry VII. also came to this city
directly from Bosworth field, and Mary Queen of
Scots was imprisoned here. The spire of Coventry
(St. Michael’s) is one of the most beautiful in
England. The church is said by the historian of
Coventry to be, next to Yarmouth, the largest in the
kingdom; but if churches (not being cathedral)
where parochial service is held are intended, neither
one or the other is nearly the largest. The quaint
irregular buildings in front form a beautiful composition
with St. Michael’s spire; they are occupied
as dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>“The parish churches, ancient hospitals, monastic
buildings, and old timber houses of Coventry,
are still numerous, and exhibit in their varied
features, historical relations, and distinctive characters,
abundant matter for the study of the architect
and antiquary,” so says Britton in his excellent work
on the <i>Antiquities of English Cities</i>. St. Mary’s
Hall is engraved in Britton’s work, and here it is
just seen on the left hand; a beautiful gable projects
before it. This hall was commenced in 1394, and
finished in 1414, on the site of an old hall; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a>{238}</span></p>

<p class="nind">buildings surround a courtyard, and are entered by
an arched gateway from the street; and it is hardly
possible in all the city architecture of England to
find a more interesting and fine apartment than the
great hall. It has been well described elsewhere.
Bablake Hospital is another ancient corporation,
and affords an admirable example of an old city
building. It was founded in the latter part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a>{239}</span>
Henry VII.’s reign by the Mayor of Coventry.
In the distance is the tower of St. John’s Church.

good state of preservation.</p>

<p>Of Ford’s Hospital, in the same city, John Carter,

<span class="caption">IRON GATE, DERBY.</span>
</div>

<p>The ecclesiastical monuments of Derby are few,
having rather more than shared the troubles of their
brethren in 1536 and 1539; and, indeed, there are
not many archæological remains of any kind in the
county, always of course excepting Hadden. The
title of the Earls of Derby is not derived from any
part of this county as has been supposed, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a>{241}</span>
the hundred of West Derby, near Liverpool. The
Iron Gate was a very fine old street till lately, but
it is somewhat changed since the drawing from
which this engraving is taken was made. The
Church of All Saints remains, however, in its
entirety.</p>

<p>There is a curious angle-post in Derby, apparently
of about Henry IV.’s time; it is very richly
panelled, but the building it supports has been much
modernised and changed.</p>

<p>Wirksworth is a market-town of considerable
antiquity, and, to judge from many architectural
decorations in the houses, it must have been of
much greater importance at one time than it is at
present. Rooms in some of the shops have fine
ceilings of Elizabethan character, and there are
several curious fire-places. At the Hope and
Anchor Inn, quite an unpretending house of accommodation,
there is a chimney-piece of great splendour.
Two tall Ionic columns support each side,
and their caps are inverted. Carved flames seem
to issue out and reach the ceiling, which is rather
high. These columns are about eight feet apart,
and except a square opening for a fire-place all the
space between them to the ceiling is covered with
rich but barbaric carvings. Wirksworth is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>{242}</span>
fourteen miles to the north-west of Derby. Wingfield
Manor is three or four miles to the south of
Matlock, and is a lovely ruin. Here Mary Queen of
Scots was confined, and the Babbington conspiracy
hatched, for which the head of the house of Tichborne
lost his life. Bradshaw, the president of the
council who tried and condemned Charles I., was a
native of Derbyshire; and of the more peaceful
residents it may suffice to say that Arkwright and
Florence Nightingale were born in this county.</p>

<p>It is impossible to close our notice of Derbyshire
without some little reference to Hadden Hall,
the seat of the Duke of Rutland; but though it is
of course on princely dimensions, there is much in
it, very much, that would suit a humbler dwelling.
The bow windows, for example, in the drawing-room
and other rooms are large wide projections, and not
a slight bulging out of a wall; and how greatly they
always add to the pleasantry of a room where the
sun can reach them at so many different angles, is
a thing that goes without telling. Whatever the
extra expense may be, it is slight as compared with
the cheerful aspect they give to a room. It is
almost impossible, indeed, to exaggerate the size to
which bow windows may be reasonably extended
with advantage. If they are too large for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>{243}</span>
winter, if the exposed surface is apt to make them
cold, nothing is easier than to shut them off with a
baize curtain. A window seat runs round the one
in the dining-room, and how much this adds to the
pleasure of a room any one who has ever seen such a
feature can tell. All these things can be arranged
with absolute economy, or they would not be here
alluded to. The private chapel at Hadden has been
admirably lithographed by Nash in his <i>Ancient
Mansions</i>, and however unsuitable it may be for an
appendage to a modern house, it is a very fine
example for a village church; parts of it are very
ancient indeed.</p>

<p>If it would be allowable, under any circumstances,
to strain the aims and purposes of the present
work, it might almost be permitted to describe
something of the ancient “home-keeping” of
Hadden in Queen Elizabeth’s days. The last
possessor of the line, in whose hands it had been so
long, was Sir George Vernon, the last male heir of
the Vernon family&mdash;“the King of the Peak” as
he was familiarly called by his neighbours. The
present appearance of the hall differs little from
that which it presented when it was finished in
Henry VIII.’s reign; of course the ancient parts of
the chapel, which to all appearance are four<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a>{244}</span>
hundred years earlier than Henry VIII., remain
as they were seen when Vernon altered it. The
hospitality of Hadden was always proverbial, and
when it changed hands, and came into the Duke of
Rutland’s family, this was not neglected. The first
Duke of Rutland is said to have employed nearly
150 servants in doing the rites of hospitality, and in
Queen Anne’s time there were twelve days’ feasts
at Christmas with accompanying revelry, the almost
expiring life of the old days of the “Lord of Misrule.”
Hadden, it is said, “like other magnificent
abodes, seems to be cut out for appearance rather
than comfort.” “The doors,” a chronicler states,
“are very rudely contrived, except where picturesque
effect is the object; few fit at all close, and their
fastenings are nothing better than wooden bolts,
clumsy bars, or iron hasps. To conceal these
defects, and exclude draughts of air, tapestry was put
up, which had to be lifted in order to pass in or
out; and when it was necessary to hold back these
hangings, there were great iron hooks fixed for the
purpose. All the principal rooms, except the gallery,
were hung with loose arras, and their doors were
concealed behind.” This, however, says nothing for
the broken beautiful style of building that prevailed
in the Tudor age, and the hundred pleasant nooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a>{245}</span>
and corners that are characteristic of it;&mdash;nooks
and corners too, that need not cost any extra
amount of money, and always make a house cheerful
and companionable. If the only objection to
these houses is that the carpentry and joiners’
work is not free from exception, this may apply to
any bad work; some of it is excellent, but some of it
rather tends to remind me of a country carpenter,
who came from Formby to Liverpool to a joiner’s
establishment at the beginning of the present
century, or the end of the last, and when he was
asked if his door would fit, by the foreman, and if
he could get a <i>hair</i> through the space between the
door and the jamb, he declared that it was impossible,
he knew how to fit a door better than that,
and said it would be as much as any <i>hare</i> could do
to put her foot through. Whatever there may be,
however, of want of precision in some of the
domestic carpentry&mdash;always remembering one thing,
that we must make due allowance for shrinking, for
the summer sun, and the winter cold, and also
remembering that the masonry, at any rate, which
was free from such exigencies, is perfect, and
evidently put up by men to whom we now could
teach very little indeed, in the plenitude of our
knowledge&mdash;nothing in this supposed shortcoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a>{246}</span>
in carpentry can prevent our taking lessons in its
general form and style. The chimneys and the doors
of Hadden are well able to give us lessons of construction,
even for modest dwellings.</p>

<p>Stratford-on-Avon is a remarkably bright-looking
cheerful town, and is, of course, more visited
than any other of its size in England. The population
is not quite 4000. In the sixteenth century
Stratford was an exceedingly beautiful town. The
houses were mostly of wood, and each situated in
its own garden. One of them still stands in High
Street, and has a well-carved front, resembling one
of the many that remain in Chester. Stratford
derives its name from the ford over the Avon that
was here, and which seems to have satisfied the
primitive manners of the people till a wooden bridge
was built; but this again was superseded by an
excellent stone one. Of course the exterior of
Shakespeare’s house, in Henley Street, is familiar
to every one; it is an ordinary specimen of a house
of about the early part of the sixteenth century.
The one which Shakespeare himself built in New
Place was pulled down in 1756, by the Rev.
Francis Gastrell, who unhappily came into possession
of the property. He first cut down the
celebrated mulberry tree that the poet had planted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a>{247}</span>
and when the inhabitants of Stratford were
astounded, he showed them that he could even
eclipse that by pulling down the house that
Shakespeare had himself designed. From Kenilworth
to Evesham, in Worcester, the Avon is full
of beauty and interest. There is the celebrated
Guy’s Cliff, Hatton Rock, where the river is confined
in its course and rapid, the splendid Warwick Castle,
the Marl Cliffs of Bidford, and Charlcote Park, while
the river itself is full of quiet English beauty. It
glides through richly cultivated meadows, and past
overhanging boughs from wooded banks; there are
long lines of alders and willows, and here and there
some quaint quiet homestead, that looks the very
embodiment of peace. Warton well describes this
part of the river:&mdash;</p>

<p>Eight villages round Stratford have been characterised,
in some well-known lines, by some old
resident who had the talent for rhyme. It is
remarkable how familiar these are to the country
people, and how invariably they ascribe them to
Shakespeare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a>{248}</span></p>

<p>Watling Street forms the north-eastern boundary
of Warwickshire, separating it from Leicestershire
for many miles, and perhaps a word may not be
quite out of place here regarding this remarkable
Roman Street. It is one of the four great roads
with which the Romans intersected the country, and
according to Mr. Hirsley, whom Camden quotes, most
of our military ways were laid by Julius Agricola, who
extended them as he pushed his conquests forward.
The others are called Hermin Street, the Fosse, and
Ikning Street. Watling Street crosses the kingdom
thrice. It goes from Richborough through London
(where it retains its name) towards Chester, then
crossing again it goes to York, and once more
it turns in a westerly direction and extends past
Carlisle. Watling Street is the name also given
to the road which goes through Wales into Anglesea;
a causeway is yet visible going out into the sea
towards that island. The three other <i>itinera</i> also
have Watling Street for their base.</p>

<p><i>Hermin Street</i>, or <i>Ermine Street</i>, is the great
military road that reaches from London to Lincoln,
and so to Wintringham, in a nearly straight line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a>{249}</span>
The <i>Fosse</i> proceeds from Bath to Lincoln, and, Dr.
Stukeley thinks, to Seaton. “I am most at a loss,”
he says, “about <i>Icknild Street</i>. Some think there
were two Roman ways of this name, but I cannot
say we are certain of either. It must have been
some way that led either to or from the country of
the <i>Iceni</i>, and that this is the reason of the name,
possibly Icen Elde Street, or old street. It is
therefore natural to suppose that <i>Venta Icenorum</i>
must have stood on this way, and perhaps been the
limit of it. The way, then, according to which the
9th iter is directed, should, I think, be best entitled
to the name of any in the Itinerary. This I shall
show to be the Roman road that came through
Caister near Norwich, by Colchester or Malden, to
London. The military road from London by Speen
and Marlborough to Bath, or rather that by Silchester
and Old Sarum to Dorchester, may be
looked upon as the continuation of it. The military
way which goes from Silchester to Old Sarum, and
so to Dorchester and Pentridge (as Mr. Gale informs
me), passes by Gussage St. Michael’s under the name
of Ickling Dyke.”... Dr. Plot, however, who was a
very learned man, and secretary to the Earl Marshall
in the year 1687, argues for an Ickning Street, which
passes through Derby and enters Stafford at Stretton<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a>{250}</span>
near Tretbury, leading by Burton-upon-Trent and
Lichfield and Warwickshire, near Handsworth,
where it appears near Birmingham.</p>

<p>The treasures that a few feet of soil cover
in Roman art are untold; wheat has grown and
cattle have grazed for centuries on many a Roman
city or villa. The town of Wroxeter, near Shrewsbury,
is lying under rich farming lands, totally
hidden from human eye. A few hundred pounds
was spent in trying to open up some part, and the
wealth of Roman remains and Roman ingenuity and
civilisation is astounding. I had occasion to go
there while writing the present chapter, and probably
few persons who have not visited our own
Herculaneum would credit the wealth of Roman art
that lies buried at our doors. A small space only has
been opened up, and baths, villas, public buildings,
and tessellated pavements met the astonished eyes
of the explorers. A space of probably 300 acres is
still covered up, and conceals we know not what.
The history of this premature civilisation of the
Romans is absolutely lost. On their leaving the
island the great roads and bridges, which the sagacious
policy of the rulers always supplied to the
colonies, fell into disuse. No longer government
property, they were pillaged or neglected, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a>{251}</span>
towns and villas, quite unsuited to the natives of
the island, were left to bats and moles. “Had
travellers or maps existed at that early period,” says
a very able writer, “they would have afforded us a
picture of numerous isolated communities, whose
continuous homesteads were surrounded with broad
patches of rich corn and pasture, and whose arable
and meadow land was fenced in by dark rings of
forest, or heaths pastured in common by the herds
and flocks of the small republic. No ‘wandering
merchant bending beneath his load,’ no adventurous
stranger smitten with the desire of roaming from
land to land, brought his wares or his tidings to
these remote villages.” But we must admit our
total ignorance of the condition of England under
Roman rule. It certainly was not military only,
let the villas with tessellated pavements testify to
that. The inhabitants were held no doubt under an
iron hand. In some lead mine I once saw in
Cardigan, the excavations came across Roman
workings; these seem to have been chipped out
little by little, and they reach to vast depths and to
long levels. The Britons whom they employed
must have spent their weary lives in a sort of
tunnel, in which it was quite impossible even to
kneel, far less to stand; yet some parts of Wales<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a>{252}</span>
are quite burrowed with these terrible holes. The
writer already quoted says, “The historian is involved
in inextricable perplexities. The few <i>civil</i>
inscriptions we possess speak of Triumvirs, Quatruumvirs,
and other municipal or fiscal magistrates.
As the personal strength of the soldier degenerates,
more care and labour are bestowed on material
fortifications. Yet how or why did the Cyclopean
walls of Chester or Leicester, or many other sturdy
encampments, crumble away before tribes unprovided
with the rudest artillery? Into what bottomless
undiscernible gulf were precipitated the Roman
municipia and their institutions? The oracles are
dumb; and we know really more of the Britons
whom Cæsar invaded and Agricola subdued, than
of the Britons whom Honorius left exposed to the
savages of the Grampians and to the adventurers
from the Elbe and Baltic.” This is true indeed,
and, though sufficient margin must be left for the
way in which Roman remains were often regarded
simply as quarries for materials by the monks, and
also for the absolute difference in race, religion, and
habits, between the Roman colonists and their
British subjects, there is much that is wholly inexplicable.
No doubt the classes, like the Cardigan
miners, whose terrible lot has been alluded to, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a>{253}</span>
be apt to desire to wipe out every trace of their
subordination. “Arise, ye Goths, and glut your ire!”
was doubtless the rallying cry of a large number
of Britons when the Romans so suddenly and
thoroughly left the island. There seems to be a
common error in turning up Roman remains, that
we hear of from those who perhaps may be well
excused for the supposition,&mdash;if a Roman hypocaust
is found, it is at once dubbed a bath; but the way
the Romans heated their rooms was similar to the
way in which Turkish baths are now commonly
warmed, except when, in milder weather, braziers
were sufficient.</p>

<p>It has justly been observed by Mr. E. J. Willson
that “no city in England contains so many interesting
specimens of architectural antiquities as York.
This observation may be especially applied to the
remains of its ancient fortifications, a class of
architecture of the greater value, since so very
few examples are now left standing in England.
Clifford’s tower and the four great gates, or bars,
are admirable specimens of the castellated style;
while the <i>posterns</i>, or lesser gates, with the towers,
turrets, and embattled walls that surround the city,
exhibit a delightful variety of curious and picturesque
forms. The view of these ancient bulwarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a>{254}</span>
forcibly recalls the mind from present scenes to
the contemplation of those stirring times when such
safeguards were necessary; and whilst we feel
grateful for the security and quiet enjoyed in our
days, it is painful to see those monuments of the
valour and skill of our ancestors sacrificed to petty
considerations of economy or to some trifling improvement.
Encircled by walls and towers, York
could never be viewed without respect, as the very
model of an ancient city.” The view of York from
Samson Square is characteristic of the city. There
are many of those narrow wynds that have been
little altered since they were built, and the Cathedral
always forms a conspicuous and delightful background.
What would Mr. E. J. Willson, who wrote
the above in 1827, have thought if he could have
known that the fine old buildings on the lower
side of Samson Square were to be destroyed to
make room for a new covered market? They are
safe yet; a majority of the council saved them for
the present. There are some very noble wooden
framed structures, one of which has been a royal
residence, and this, with the others, it was proposed
to sweep away for the market. I met a gentleman
in the city, at the hotel, who explained the whole
circumstances to me, and expressed his regret that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255"></a>{255}</span></p>

<br />
<span class="caption">SAMSON SQUARE, YORK.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">the narrow-minded prejudices of the majority&mdash;only
a small one&mdash;prevented a great public improvement
from being carried out! “What a site for a market!”
the spirited burgess remarked,&mdash;“drainage all
the way to the river, and nothing to do but sweep
away some old lumbering property that has been
standing in the way for a couple of hundred years
or more.” It was rather pleasant to find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a>{256}</span>
one who owned to being so thorough a spoliator,
though the remarks in reply were not complimentary.
There is another drawing of York which occupies
the next place, and represents the west end of the
Minster, with a college on the right hand side.
This is called St. William’s College. It is a very
imposing old building, quadrangular in form, and
the interior of the quadrangle is extremely impressive
and grand, but now it is let off to cottage
tenants. The noble pile was built by Henry VI.
for the chantry priests to reside in. In one of
the rooms Charles I. set up the royal printing
presses in the year 1642. This was the time
when York may be said to have been his sole
metropolis. And opposite this interesting street is
Goodramgate, where another college for the
vicars choral was established. This also belonged
to the Minster. Of course the grand Cathedral
forms no part of the scope of this work; but we
all of us know how splendidly it towers above the
city, making itself conspicuous everywhere; and
the tradition that one hears all round the precincts,
that high in the windows the gorgeous glass is
principally composed of precious stones, becomes
half credible if we look to the clerestory on a
bright summer’s day,&mdash;indeed I am well informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a>{257}</span></p>

<p class="nind">that in many chapels on the Continent very thin
slices of precious stones have been introduced in
judicious places, and they form a bright spot for the
eye to rest on. Goodramgate or Guthrum’s Gate,
or Street, is called after Guthrum, the Danish leader
who fought against King Alfred; and here is the
Church of St. Crux, in the pavement near which
stood until lately a market cross and tolbooth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258"></a>{258}</span>
here also is an old doorway formerly leading to
the Merchants’ Hall, the interior of which is extremely
interesting. It contains two halls, one of
which is hung round with some fine old portraits,
and underneath there is a chapel. This hall was
formerly an hospital, and was founded about the
year 1373, and dissolved by Edward VI., along
with many other religious houses, chapels, and
chantries.</p>

<p>Walmgate Bar has been kept in good repair
and order by the city corporation, and is even in a
better state than when W. H. Bartlett made his
drawing of it for Britton’s <i>Picturesque Antiquities
of English Cities</i>. It is in the entrance from
Beverly, Hull, Lincoln, etc., and is supposed to derive
its name from a corruption of Watling Street, the
great Roman road that has already been alluded
to, and in all probability this supposition is correct.</p>

<p>Micklegate Bar forms the chief entrance to
York from the London road; and has been more
noticed than any of the other bars, from its advantageous
position. The stone of the gate singularly
shows its variety of date, and corresponds with the
architectural features that adorn it. Drake, the
historian of York, Britton tells us, regarded the
stone-grit as a certain indication of Roman architecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259"></a>{259}</span>
and he went so far as to suppose that the
semicircular arches were of Roman construction
from their form; but this hardly stands the test of
somewhat more modern criticism, though the Earl
of Burlington and other distinguished antiquaries
of the period fully held the same view; but Mr.
J. Essex, in <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. iv., has quite refuted
this, as has also Sir H. Englefield in his observations
on the ancient buildings of York. Britton
truly says that “no person who has studied the
peculiarities of ancient architecture can fail to
recognise the Norman style in these three arches.
The upper part of the building may be pretty safely
referred to the reign of Edward III., whose arms,
old France and England quarterly, are sculptured
on a large shield in the centre, between two shields
bearing the arms of York City.” The outwork was
sometimes called the Barbican or Turnpike, from its
being guarded by a military engine of that particular
name.</p>

<p>Bootham Bar, Britton says, was rebuilt after the
dreadful vengeance that William the Conqueror
inflicted on the city after its revolt in the year 1070.
It crosses the old Roman road, and was much
damaged in the wars of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Coney Street runs almost parallel to the River<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a>{260}</span>
Ouse, between Sampson Square and the water; and
in many of the houses, such as the old George
Hotel, are traces of former splendour; indeed at one
time this street was the favourite quarter for the
residences of the nobility and gentry. Too frequently
Micklegate Bar was used for exhibiting
the decapitated heads of partisans of different reigning
houses, especially during the wars of the Roses.
The heads of Richard Duke of York, the Earl of
Northumberland, Lord Scrope, and Lords Devonshire
and Wiltshire, with many others of similar rank,
have been exposed on this bar after the senseless
quarrels were over or lulled.</p>

<p class="nind">The old prints of London bridge show these shocking
accompaniments to ancient street scenes; and
indeed to translate them into modern language, the
photographs of the Greek brigands that were
clustered in a group after murdering some estimable
English gentlemen are only a reflex. These
photographs, after whatever feeble justice could be
done, are yet exposed in London.</p>

<p>Stonegate Street overlooks the Cathedral from
the south side, and at every step there is some
view that would gladden the eye of Prout or Cattermole.
The south transept opens up at every turn,
and forms some new combination with the surrounding
quaint old houses. The colouring is extremely
rich and beautiful, the various tints of ochre being
freely used on the fronts of the buildings, and many
quaint old windows and gables thrust themselves in
front of their neighbours, as if in amicable rivalry
which could be the most picturesque.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Ouse bridge, Britton says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262"></a>{262}</span>
“The superior construction of bridges may justly be
the boast of modern architecture. Those of the
middle ages were generally built in a clumsy and
unscientific manner, with huge piers and straight
arches; the passage over them was usually narrow,
and in towns they were generally covered by shops
and houses built on their sides. Notwithstanding
these inconveniences, the picturesque features of
some of those old buildings make their destruction
a matter of regret to the admirers of antiquity.
The Ouse bridge at York was chiefly remarkable
for the size of its central arch, which certainly was
an extraordinary effort of art, its span exceeding
that of any arch in England, until the erection of
Blackfriars Bridge in London.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This arch was
pointed, but approached nearly to a circular curve.
It had been built in the reign of Elizabeth after a
great flood had swept away part of the bridge with
twelve of the houses standing on it,” and it had been
recently taken down when Britton wrote. It must
have been intensely picturesque. There was a chapel
at one end with a lancet front; and under it were
two pointed cavernous arches spanning the water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a>{263}</span>
while at the other side were tall houses like those in
Rotterdam, with buttresses and mullioned windows.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">RICHMOND, YORKSHIRE.</span>
</div>

<p>The illustration here given of Richmond is from
the Market Square, and it affords a characteristic idea
of the singular scenes that sometimes meet us in
outlying country towns. It has been asserted that
a cannon fired down the streets of Richmond or
Pontefract, at any time of the day, would not be
likely to entail a coroner’s inquest. Camden gives
a curious charter, by which the town of Richmond
was conveyed away in the time of William the Conqueror:
“I, William, King of England, do give, and
grant to thee, my nephew, Alan, Earl of Bretagne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264"></a>{264}</span>
and to thy heirs for ever, all the villages and lands
which of late belonged to Earl Edwin in Yorkshire,
with the knights’ fees, and other liberties and
customs as freely and honourably (?) as the same
Edwin held them. Dated from our siege before
York.” Many streets yet retain their Norman
names, and the vast castle, of which the keep remains
in a state of high preservation, was now
built. The keep is 99 feet in height, and the walls
are 11 feet in thickness. The tower and chapel,
here shown, and so strangely mixed up with houses
and shops, formerly stood in the castle walls, and
are the remains of the garrison church, which was
built in the twelfth century and rebuilt in 1360.
This church has had a singular history. The
patronage of it was vested in the corporation at
the time of the Reformation, and they seem to have
used the building for purposes certainly different
from those which its founders intended. Until the
Town Hall was built in 1756, the north aisle was
used for the town sessions; then it was a consistory
court; and now it is added again to the church,
excepting some small shops, which are, as it were,
inserted into it. It is to be hoped that no dispute
will ever arise about party walls or rights of any kind,
for there would be rather some nice points of law<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a>{265}</span>
and evidence. Thus, in a curious way, some dwelling-houses
are inserted between the nave and the tower;
these belong partly to the church and partly to the
corporation. The tower, however, belongs entirely
to the corporation. The patronage formerly was
possessed by Mr. Cooke, but Lord Zetland purchased
it and presented it to the trustees of the
Grammar School, so that now the whole block is
fairly confused. The way in which Richmond was
entailed on a follower of the Conqueror is a curious
instance of the manner in which such grants were
commonly made, and in the <i>Registrum honoris de
Richmond</i> there is a most singular illumination of
the investment. The lucky nephew is kneeling
down, while the king is presenting him with a charter
to which the great seal is attached; and thus villages
and manors were given away in every direction by
the stranger king. Domesday Book is the most
extraordinary book perhaps that now exists; it gives
an absolutely accurate description of England, excepting
some few of the northern counties, and it is
quoted at the present day as indisputable authority
in the courts of justice. No other country
possesses anything at all like it, and it strikingly
exhibits the damage done by pillage and conquest.</p>

<p>The date of the survey is 1086, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a>{266}</span>
seen by special permission. It is said that by the
Conquest the rental of England diminished in
twenty years to one-fourth of what it was under
Edward the Confessor. Thierry has shown in his
history how complete the spoliation of the kingdom
was by the Norman conquerors. “The king’s name
was placed at the head of the county, with a list of
his domains and revenues; then followed the names
of the chief and inferior proprietors, in the order
of their military rank and their territorial wealth.
The Saxons, who by special favour had been
spared the spoliation, were found only in the lowest
schedule; for the number of that race who still
continued to be free proprietors, or tenants in chief
to the king, as the conquerors called it, were such
only for small domains. They were inscribed at
the end of each chapter under the name of thanes
of the king, or by some other designation of
domestic service in the royal household. The rest
of the names of an Anglo-Saxon form, that are
scattered here and there through the roll, belong to
farmers holding by a precarious title a few fractions,
larger or smaller, of the domains of the Norman
earls, barons, knights, sergeants, and bowmen.”</p>

<p>There is little of interest in Ripon besides the
Cathedral. The houses have generally been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a>{267}</span></p>

<p class="nind">modernised, and they do not seem to be more than about a
century or a century and a half old. The dedication
of Ripon Church was attended by Egfrid, king
of Northumbria, who feasted the people for three
days; and here it may be in place to allude to these
dedications as bearing on some village customs that
have died out happily in nearly every part of
England&mdash;the rush-bearings, the wakes, and church
ales. Gregory the Great bade St. Augustine not to
destroy the pagan temples, but only the idols that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a>{268}</span>
were in them, purifying the site and sprinkling it
with holy water, etc.; and because the people were in
the habit of assembling on certain days, and having
their orgies and feasts to their gods, the crafty
pontiff knew it would weaken his hold on them to
bring such things to a sudden conclusion, and ordered
that these bacchanalia were still to be continued, but
kept on the saint’s day the church was dedicated
to; and in the then condition of the people that
would tend rather to attach them to the new
religion. The Unicorn Inn in Ripon has some
slight traces of antiquity, but it is more as a foreground
to the west front of the Cathedral, than to any
particular merits of its own, it owes its architectural
value.</p>

<p>The fine old three-gabled house at Wakefield,
here shown, was probably built about the same time
as the battle of Wakefield; it is now divided into
small shops, and the carved work has been much defaced
and removed. There is nothing in it essentially
different from any other black-and-white house that
may be seen in Chester or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, figures in the
third part of “Henry VI.,” and is now in ruins, and
the Duke of York wished to remain here on the
defensive against the army of 20,000 that Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a>{269}</span></p>

<p>Margaret had mustered under promise of plunder if
her cause should be successful. The Duke’s forces
mustered not more than a quarter of the number,
but the Earl of Salisbury prevailed on him to
advance to meet the Queen’s army. When the
Yorkists advanced in good order they probably did
not even guess at the superior forces they were
pitted against, and as their leader was allowed to
advance towards Wakefield he was cut off from
Sandal, and was nearly the first to fall. His head, as
we have seen, was put on York gates, and scenes of
exceptional barbarity, even for the Wars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>{270}</span>
Roses, followed Margaret’s victory. The Duke of
York’s son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, was murdered
with great cruelty after the battle, by Lord Clifford,
at Wakefield bridge. He is made to say in “Henry
VI.”</p>

<p>The chapel on Wakefield bridge, which was in a
ruinous condition till the late Vicar of Wakefield
restored it, was built by Edward IV., the brother of
the young Rutland who was murdered by Clifford.
He erected it on the spot where his brother was slain.
The intercession of the young Rutland for his life is
powerfully told in Shakespeare, and the gibes and
jeers that Clifford gave way to when he stabbed
him. Even Clifford’s own party could not excuse this
act, for Rutland is always described as an extremely
amiable gentle youth. Hall says that not a few of
his party after the murder stigmatised Clifford as
“no gentleman,” a censure that we cannot say
errs on the side of severity when judged by our
modern ideas. These wayside chapels, we are told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271"></a>{271}</span></p>

<p class="nind">were the only places of public worship to which
no burial-ground was attached. “They had no
walled enclosure, and could never have been more
alone than many are now on the highways to Walsingham.
Those near Hillborough have been planted
on the bleak brows of elevated ground near the
roadside, and are without particular architectural
distinction, etc. The interior, which could once
afford rest to the weary and a pittance to the distressed,
is now too desolate to be sought as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a>{272}</span>
refuge by cattle.” This chapel at Wakefield was at
one time such a place, for it is supposed to have
been originally built in the time of Edward II., and
no doubt correctly so supposed, but it was transformed
or almost rebuilt in the superb form we see
it now, in the reign of Edward IV. In case this
wonderful chapel may not be understood with
sufficient clearness, it may be well to remark that it
occupies a sort of large pier, an exaggerated kind of
buttress to the bridge. The windows are certainly
curious and beautiful: the singular part of them is
that they contain a two-centred head in a square,
the spandrels being pierced.</p>

<p>Pontefract is rather a disappointment to those
who visit it for the first time, and who are expecting
to see much of its ancient glories left. The house
here shown is rather curious, and evidently of considerable
antiquity. The outside stair and the slits
in the wall are defensive, but sash windows have
replaced mullions, and now it is a good substantial
farm-house. The population of the town is said to
be nearly 12,000, but they are nearly all cottagers,
and apparently in rather humble circumstances.
The rocky foundation on which the castle was built
is now a valuable quarry of filtering stones, that are
sent to all parts of the kingdom. The liquorice-grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a>{273}</span></p>

making of pomfret cakes forms quite an industry
among the natives. Few if any castles in England
have played so conspicuous a part in the history of
the country. It was built by Ilbert de Lacy, a
follower of the Conqueror. He received as his
share of the plunder 150 manors in Yorkshire,
ten in Nottingham, and four in Lincolnshire.
The gentle baron took a fancy to Pontefract
because he considered that it bore a resemblance
to his old home in Normandy, and readily had
it transferred from its original possessor to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274"></a>{274}</span>
The area enclosed by the castle walls is said
to have been about seven acres, and it was of
course fortified with all engineering expedients then
known. The dungeons are a remarkable feature
here, not only on account of their stern forbidding
appearance, but from the number and importance of
the prisoners who have been confined in them.
Pontefract Castle was the seat of the Earl of Lancaster
in the reign of Edward II., when the country
was torn to pieces by factions, and the Royalists and
the house of Lancaster fought for predominance.
In one of the battles the Earl of Lancaster was
defeated and taken to his own castle, and there,
without a hearing, and under circumstances of great
barbarity, he was put to death. In the short reign
also of Richard III. many great men were confined
in these dungeons, and afterwards executed; Woodville,
Gray, and Rivers among the rest. This castle
held out longer than any other against the army of
Cromwell; indeed was not taken till after Charles
was executed. A singular tale is told of its final
surrender and demolition. It would seem that
when the Royalists were reduced to straits, General
Lambert, who commanded the Parliamentarians,
summoned them to surrender, and offered them
honourable terms. The only ones he excepted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275"></a>{275}</span>
these terms were six gentlemen who were obnoxious
to Cromwell, and these he said it was desirable to
have executed. The garrison, who were composed
principally of Nottingham men, objected to this, and
asked Lambert to agree to the following singular
condition:&mdash;the castle was to be held for a week
longer, and then surrendered; but if, in the interim,
these six gentlemen could escape by fair means, they
were to be permitted. Lambert said if he only had
his own way he would let them all off free, and
rejoice at it, but he was completely tied down by
his instructions; however, he would take upon himself
to agree to the week. Several skirmishes took
place during this week, and four of the six besieged
gentlemen effected their escape. It is not improbable
that no very great diligence was employed in their
capture. Still, however, two remained, Sir Hugh
Cartwright and another, and they would not let any
further trouble or loss be incurred on their behalf, so
they found a chamber in the walls, and caused
themselves to be loosely walled in with a month’s
provisions in the room. They calculated that the
castle would be retaken by the Royalists within the
month. The garrison then surrendered, and Lambert
reduced the castle to the ruinous condition in
which it now is; and the tale that passed current was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276"></a>{276}</span>
that he just happened to pass the part where they
were concealed, and they escaped and went abroad;
at any rate one of them died at Antwerp some
time after.</p>

<p>The doorway with the royal arms, which is
correctly shown here, is in a cottage opposite the
castle, and no doubt at one
time was connected with
the great establishment. It
is evidently only part of a
much more important building,
and probably stood in
the castle enclosures. It is
hardly necessary to remark
here that it was at Pontefract
Castle that Richard II.
met his death in the year
1400, when only thirty-five years of age. Nothing
is known of the manner of his death. Some suppose
that he was murdered or starved to death, as
the two gentlemen in Cromwell’s time might have
been but for timely accidents; and tradition says
that Sir Piers Exton, with a select band of assassins,
murdered him there, that a stout resistance was
made, and some were killed besides the king.</p>

<p>Beverley is near Hull, and perhaps rather remote
from the parts of the island that are most commonly
traversed. It is a town, however, of great beauty
and interest, and contains among other attractions
two fine old churches. One, St. Mary’s, has been
engraved in some recent works, and the minster
has quite the proportions and style of a first-class
cathedral. Britton remarks that it resembles Salisbury
in plan and general style. The ancient family
of Percy were great benefactors to the building; and
the shrine, commonly called the Percy Shrine, built
apparently in the fifteenth century, is very commonly
regarded as the finest piece of workmanship that is
left us from the mediæval ages. This family possessed
two grand residences in the neighbourhood&mdash;Leconfield
Manor and Wressel Castle.</p>

<p>The lamp with which this chapter is closed is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a>{278}</span>
good example of old wrought-iron work. It may
have been constructed any time from the Edwardean
period to the Stewart age; for, singularly enough,
there are no features in this class of wrought-iron
work that indicate any period in the same way as
stone-work does. With close attention some slight
character may be detected in a leaf, but generally
such an index as this is quite wanting.</p>

the principles of brickwork that have been the

The houses of Beverley are good, and it is resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280"></a>{280}</span>

<br />
<span class="caption">MARKET SQUARE, BEVERLEY, YORKSHIRE.</span>
</div>

<p>In the market place, which the engraver has
given an excellent idea of, is a quaint cross of the
Carolean period. This market place occupies
some four acres, and is a perfect gem of picturesque
town beauty. The cross must have been among
the last that were built as market crosses. The
history of these beautiful remains, that have done so
much to enliven old towns and cities, may be told in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281"></a>{281}</span>
a few words. They were devoted to various uses.
Sometimes they were preaching crosses, as the one
at <i>Iron Acton</i>, where probably in very warm
weather the vicar or incumbent would address the
congregation in the open air, or, like the black friars
in Hereford, where the pulpit cross seems to have
stood in cloisters. Sometimes they were memorial
crosses, like the three grand Eleanor crosses that are
left us out of the original twelve; and it is satisfactory
to be able to think that these beautiful
memorials will again be copied very freely. The
colonies even are beginning to erect some imitations
of the Waltham cross,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and indeed its marvellous
beauty speaks for itself. At one time there were
certainly 5000 crosses in England, but they were so
easily destroyed in Cromwell’s time, that very little
trace of all this luxuriance of architecture is left.
Some crosses may be buried only a foot under the
soil, and noble examples lost to our sight; indeed it
is by no means uncertain that we shall not be able
to add at least one Eleanor cross to our list, if not
two. The Chester Cross was buried for years,
indeed centuries, before it was discovered in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a>{282}</span>
St. Peter’s Church, only a few inches below the footwalk,
apparently placed reverently by some careful
hand; and since these pages have been commenced,
and in some very recent alterations to Neston church
in this neighbourhood, the remains of three fine stone
crosses were exhumed. A cross filled many uses,
as has been said, but it was always contrived to
make it an object of beauty to the neighbourhood.
The Charing Cross that has been recently erected
opposite the new hotel is one of the most successful
that has been put up in modern days, and much
resembles the roadside one at Waltham. From
these old crosses proclamations used to be read,
and tolls collected from the market people. The
modern drinking-fountain also is an adaptation of
the idea that suggested some of the crosses, and
several of the old conduits might be copied with great
advantage. The one at Sherborne, which has been
illustrated in these pages, would be an excellent
model for a drinking-fountain, and one that has not
yet been copied. The covered market cross at
Beverley is one of the last that was built, and
answered the same purposes as those of Salisbury
or Malmesbury. These were merely covered spaces
for country people to rest in, in the heat and the
rain, and generally connected with some religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283"></a>{283}</span>
house in the neighbourhood. They were usually
octagonal and richly groined. That at Chichester is
the most elaborate, though the more ancient one at
Salisbury, engraved in page 119, is the most graceful
and picturesque in the country. One thing
strikes us in these crosses&mdash;the smallness of the
accommodation for a public market; but then, as now,
the market square was covered with awnings or
tents. And one of the most picturesque sights in
England is an old market square like the one at
Hexham, or the one at Salisbury, with their booths,
on a busy market-day. Sometimes a cross was built
on an octagonal shaft surmounted with a crucifix,
or a head with niches and small statues, and an
octagonal covering was built up round it reaching to
about half the height of the original shaft. This,
as at Cheddar in Somerset, is sometimes of later
date, and sometimes, as at Shepton-Mallet, in the
same vicinity, built contemporaneously with the
central column. In great numbers of villages
we find flights of steps where a cross has once
stood; but the eyesore being removed, the Puritans
allowed the steps to remain. In Malpas these
are of enormous dimensions, and when they were
surmounted with a tall cross the effect in this
picturesque little country town must have been most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a>{284}</span>
striking. As a rule, our modern representations of
crosses have not been very successful; they are
wanting in lightness and ingenuity. One mode of
decoration, however, that is thoroughly unsuited to
our climate, we are not likely to see renewed, and
that is the gilding of crosses. The magnificent
cross at Coventry was regilded in the reign of
James II., and is said to have used up 15,403
books of gold.</p>

<p>Beverley was at one time surrounded by lakes
that were formed by the overflowing of the Humber,
and its name is said to be derived from Beaver
lake, as at one time these animals were very
abundant in this part of Yorkshire. There is a
grammar school here of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The towns of Scarborough and Whitby contain
nothing at all that could illustrate the subject
in hand; indeed, on the accession of Queen
Elizabeth, Whitby only contained thirty or forty
houses.</p>

<p>In the adjoining county of Westmoreland there is
not very much that comes within our range. The
beauty of the county needs no telling here. The
English lakes are hardly excelled in beauty anywhere
in the world, but of course their requirements
for modern travel have caused a modern growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a>{285}</span>
of architecture. The ruins of the castle where
Catherine Parr was born are near Kendal, but
the town itself contains nothing of interest architecturally.</p>

<p>Appleby, the county town, was at one time a
place of importance, but it was twice burned down
during the wars, and the present appearance is
quite modern. Ambleside is a charming town almost
entirely composed of modern detached cottages,
each in its own garden.</p>

<p>The county of Northumberland suffered, like
Dorset, severely, from incursions of the Danes,
though in the former county they were suffered to
settle after their overthrow by King Alfred; and
Mr. G. Tate, in an interesting history of Alnwick,
has given a curious list of Danish words that
are still preserved in the dialect spoken about that
town.</p>

<p>Indeed he shows that every word which is of
strange origin has come from Scandinavia. This
work of Mr. Tate’s was reviewed some ten years
since, in the <i>Builder</i>, in a very interesting article,
from which I do not hesitate to borrow.</p>

<p>The writer says that in general the people who
visit Alnwick for the first time feel sadly disappointed.
They look upon it as the ancient home<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286"></a>{286}</span>
of the Percies, and almost expect to find men in
mediæval costume, or at any rate they do think that
the town should have the appearance of some newly
fought field, and there should be some few pieces of
armour lying about; and often the disappointment is
expressed loudly at the first sight of the small quiet
gray town lying in its green basin. Wordsworth
and Pennant even make no secret of their chagrin,
as they found their hopes all scattered; and Halleck,
the American poet, is very much exercised at the
appearance of the liveried menial who let him
through the ancient halls of Hotspur and his wife,
for the modest sum of “ten shillings and sixpence
sterling.” Yet it seems that the inhabitants are all
antiquaries, either from the associations with which
they are surrounded or the force of old customs, and
there is hardly a tradesman that does not possess
some collection of local antiquities. Mr. Tate
reinvests Alnwick, as it were, with some of its ancient
glories. He says, “When several of our great towns
were mere villages, Alnwick was a walled town and
enjoyed a corporate existence; warlike barons,
wielding power little less than regal, resided within
its great castle, ruled their vassals, and hatched their
plots against their sovereign, or devised schemes for
public liberty. Malefactors were executed there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287"></a>{287}</span>
and grisly and gory heads were exhibited over the
gates; mitred abbots and cowled monks lived hard
by, and dispensed a splendid hospitality within their
abbeys. Old customs lingered long here; and there
yet remains somewhat of the racy savour of olden
times, in the tastes and associations of the
inhabitants.”</p>

<p>The Percies were in possession of Alnwick at
least 120 years before it was walled and fortified,
and the wall that surrounded it does not seem to
have differed very much from that of Chester. The
Border warfare, or rather perhaps armed plunder,
that one might almost have supposed was inherited
from the Danish blood that flowed in the veins of
the northern people, accounts for much of their
architecture.</p>

<p>When Worcester says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;&mdash;“The fox<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ne’er so tame, so cherished, and locked up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will have a wild trick of his ancestors,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">he might have been alluding to the neighbours by
whom Hotspur was surrounded. It is computed
that no less than 2000 men must have been employed
in a complicated system of day and night
watching to guard against the lawless raids of the
Middle Ages. The day watches began their duty at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288"></a>{288}</span>
daylight, and blew a horn on the approach of the
foe, and all men were bound on pain of death to
follow the fray with hue and cry. Goods captured
from the Scots were restored to the owner, and the
capturer was rewarded. No man was permitted
to speak to a Scotsman without leave from the
warder, so great a terror did the inroads of the
Northerners cause among the English.</p>

<p>Perhaps there may have been a reverse to this
picture, and the hands of the Englishmen were not
quite clean. The conduct of the stout Earl of Northumberland
in Chevy Chase is not such as we can
well excuse. He certainly had no pretence of right
on his side to take three summer days of pleasure
in the Scottish woods, and kill and bring back to Alnwick
the chiefest harts in Douglas’s manor. This
must always have struck even the most youthful
admirer of the beautiful ballad. Then they were
not satisfied with moderate, or indeed excellent
sport. A hundred fallow deer did not appease the
“stout Earl” and his friends, for they seem to have
coolly prepared for further hunting. The chronicler
simply says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And long before high noon they had<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A hundred fat bucks slain;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To rouse them up again.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289"></a>{289}</span></p>

<p class="nind">This ballad is evidently written in the interests of
the English, and whoever may have been generally
most to blame in the Border quarrels, it is clear that
the English on the occasion of Chevy Chase had a
good deal of wrong on their side.</p>

<p>The waits were suppressed in 1831 by the Corporation.
They used to last from Martinmas to
January, and Mr. Tate remembers the criers perambulating
the town at night with a “Good morrow,
masters all! half-past three on a frosty morning;”
and once or twice a week altering their apostrophe
to the name of a householder, “Good morrow,
Mistress Turner! half-past two on a cloudy morning.”
Singular as such customs may seem now,
it is only a comparatively few years since constables
used to perambulate the city at night
time in Liverpool and other large towns, using
almost similar language. Fortunately the establishment
of new police has deprived them of the
power of paying off some old grudge against any
particular inhabitant who might be supposed to
require information about the time of night and
the state of the weather; and the watchman with
his lantern has now become a thing of the past,&mdash;more
so even than mail-coaches with their rumbles
and horns, which, indeed, have not even yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290"></a>{290}</span>

<p>Hexham is a very imposing-looking town, as it
is approached from the railway. The Moot Hall
and the Abbey Church occupy commanding features
in the landscape. The Abbey Church was at one
time a cathedral, dedicated to St. Andrew. Every
building in Hexham that can boast of any antiquity
bears testimony to the disturbed state of the old
times. This is the case also with Haltwhistle, on
the left bank of the Tyne, and other Northumbrian
towns. Those who are in the habit of spending
time in amateur gardening may be interested to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291"></a>{291}</span>
know that the gloves called “Hexham tans” are
manufactured here, and sent into the country to be
sold at exactly double the price they bring in
Hexham. Formerly hats like the Monmouth caps
were made here, but, as in Monmouth, all the
factories are now closed. Hexham has produced
two remarkable chroniclers&mdash;John of Hexham and
Prior Richard.</p>

<br />
<span class="caption">BLACK GATE, NEWCASTLE.</span>
</div>

<p>The Black Gate at Newcastle-on-Tyne is a
singular example of the architecture of the period
we have been describing. Gloomy and forbidding it
looks, as if really every man’s hand was against his
neighbour, and his neighbour’s against him. It has
been recently destroyed, but the engraving is taken
from a photograph that was fortunately made before.
Of course the windows are modern in comparison
with the rest of the building. This gate was built<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293"></a>{293}</span>
at an enormous cost in the reign of Henry III., and,
as a recent chronicler has said, “it is apt to
convey a gloomy impression of Norman character
and times, in passing under the low and narrow arch.
Louring and characteristic is the effect of its great
depth, thirty-six feet, and suggestive of thoughts of
the awful dungeons of the mighty barons, and the
deeds of cruelty too often perpetrated in them.”
The older fortifications were quite inadequate for
the defence of Newcastle against the Scots, who
seem to have ravaged it at will. Part of them
remained until very recently behind the priory of
Black Friars.</p>

<p>The history of the walls is very illustrative of the
times. On one of the inroads of the Scots, after
they had exhausted the old programme of plunder
and fire, they carried off a wealthy citizen with them
to Scotland, and held him for ransom. This was
not long in coming, and on his return to his town he
resolved to protect the city with walls in order to
prevent similar accidents. In this he was assisted
by the inhabitants and the King, and he was
enabled to build a wall of twelve feet high and eight
feet thick, strongly resembling, it is said, the walls of
Avignon. This wall measured about a mile and three
quarters in circuit, and was surrounded with a ditch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294"></a>{294}</span>
of more than twenty yards in breadth. There were
said to be seven gates in these walls, and seventeen
round towers, and effigies of men cut in stone to
represent watchers. All these works were completed
in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>A description of Durham would hardly be complete
without some reference to St. Cuthbert, to
whom the See owes its origin. He was originally a
cowherd, but believing that he had a calling for holy
orders he left his sheep in the wilderness and soon
obtained admission. His piety and austere life at
once marked him out for high office, and he ultimately
became Bishop of Lindisfarne. This office was no
sinecure in his day, and it required all the efforts of
the ecclesiastics and their see to preserve any of their
property from the ravages of the Danish invasions,
which seem to have occurred as often as it was supposed
there was anything worth plundering, and they
could collect sufficient men to plunder, with the
necessary ships and arms.</p>

<p>Lindisfarne Island is the part most exposed to
any incursions of the Danes, and the ecclesiastics
finally grew tired of the wearisome and unequal contest
and determined to remove to safer quarters; and
after various wanderings, in which they carried with
them the body of St. Cuthbert, they finally rested at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295"></a>{295}</span></p>

<p>Durham. The saint, who during many years retained
his flesh and natural appearance, pointed out this
spot, and the corpse seemed very angry when they
attempted to pass it in quest of any other. This, of
course, decided the question finally, and so Durham
was originally founded. It would be impossible to
find a more magnificent site for a building in England
than that which Durham Cathedral occupies.
The Wear sweeps round a bluff that is covered with
noble trees, and above this rise the three vast towers
of the cathedral, all of which are reflected in the still
broad water below.</p>

<p>From the churchyard, also, of St. Oswald’s, the
view, though striking, is very different. Here the
great central tower is the prominent object, supported
by the western ones rising in the rear; while another
grand view of the building presents itself from Palace
Green, a large open space on the north side of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enormous advantages that
such a building must afford to the landscape of a city,
the streets are not very picturesque, and there is an
unpleasantly squalid look about nearly all parts of it.
From the railway station or the banks of the Wear
the views are incomparably grand; but, like Constantinople
seen from the Bosphorus, the charm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296"></a>{296}</span>

Antiquities of English Cities</i>, must have been
one of the most picturesque objects in the kingdom.
It was formed of pointed arches finely ribbed underneath,
and it supported a pile of gabled houses with
tall chimneys and ancient balconies of unsurpassed
beauty, and variety of form. The windows were
deeply recessed and mullioned, and there were stacks
of tall chimneys, square, octagonal, and divided into
stages; indeed, if these buildings had been simply
taken as examples of mediæval architecture, they
would have been extremely valuable, but spreading
over a fine roomy old bridge and reflected in the
waters below, they formed a picture that was a loss
to the nation when it was destroyed.</p>

<p>The view of Durham Castle here given, as the
city is entered over the bridge, is very striking. It
seems as if it must have been secure from the attacks
of any enemy, with such contrivances of offence as
were then known, and well suited for the residence
of a line of bishops whose weapons of warfare were
but too often carnal.</p>

<p>Kepier Hospital stands on the banks of the
Wear, and is a delightful resort for the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297"></a>{297}</span>
Durham. The gateway here given is easily fixed as
to date, from the arms on the keystones of the groining;
they are those of two masters of the hospital
from the years 1341 to 1345, and this date exactly
corresponds with the style of architecture. The
remains of the hospital itself are inside the gateway
and of much later date. It is occupied as a country
inn, and some of the rooms are filled with magnificent
oak carvings.</p>

<p>Kepier Hospital was endowed with the large sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298"></a>{298}</span>
of £186 per annum, which the bishops of Durham
had given it out of the plenitude of their riches, and
a list of the offices of the thirteen brethren will throw
some light upon the singular requirements of the age.
Six of these were to be chaplains; the seventh
brother was to be dispenser and larderer; the eighth
was keeper of the tannery; ninth the baker; tenth the
miller; eleventh the gauger; twelfth the keeper of
stock; and the thirteenth general proctor for all business
of the hospital.</p>

<p class="nind">to resist some sudden violence, and tell the bygone
tale of insecurity. For nearly two centuries Carlisle
lay in ruins from the ravages of
the Danes, and it was only restored
in the time of William
Rufus. He planted a colony
of Flemings there&mdash;their type
of feature is still to be noticed
among the inhabitants&mdash;and he
encouraged an immigration of
husbandmen from the south.
The singular way in which a
type of feature is preserved from
generation to generation is certainly
exhibited in Chester, in
the Roman character of many
of the features of the country
people near the city. This has
never been noticed, as far as I know, and it was
only in looking over a collection of Roman coins
that it occurred to me. These characteristics are
especially to be noticed in the coins of Hadrian, or
Claudius, or Agricola&mdash;a full neck, a Roman nose,
and strongly marked features; indeed, nobody can
go through the Chester market on a Saturday, and
observe the various types of feature, without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300"></a>{300}</span>
struck with these peculiarities in the Cheshire
women.</p>

<p>The old houses at Hexham which are engraved
at the end of the chapter, are extremely characteristic
of the older northern towns, where cut stone
is more in vogue than “post and petrel.”</p>

<div class="blockquot1"><p>MOORE RENTAL&mdash;ISLE OF MAN&mdash;BERESFORD HOPE’S REMARKS&mdash;EXPRESSION
IN ARCHITECTURE&mdash;REMARKS BY GODWIN&mdash;CONTRACT
FOR BUILDING ST. MARY’S CHURCH, CHESTER&mdash;GENERAL
PRINCIPLES&mdash;GREEK ARCHITECTURE&mdash;CONCLUSION.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span><span class="letra2">HERE</span> are some curious memoranda in a work
called the “Moore Rental,” that will throw much
light upon the way in which streets were built, and
the license allowed to tenants. Sir Edward Moore
owned a large property on the north side of Liverpool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302"></a>{302}</span>
and this was sold to the Earl of Derby for the
small sum of £12,000. The annual rental is many
times that sum in the present day. The date of the
“Rental” is 1667, and it is marked by singular
candour and simplicity. Extracts only can be given.
It is addressed to his son:</p>

<p>“<i>Old Hall Street.</i>&mdash;Make your leases according
to my new leases in Moore Street, without boons,
otherwise they will not build. Be careful of the
clause to grind at your mill, it is a great thing to
your estate, and see your tenants observe it well.</p>

<p>“Take this notice from me, what you expect
your tenants to do let them be well bound in their
leases, otherwise riches and pride is so predominant
over them in this town, together with a perfect antipathy
they have against all gentlemen&mdash;much more
your family, in regard you know your interest is
always to curb them. I know this by experience,
that they are the most perfidious knaves to their
landlords in all England, therefore I charge you
never to trust them.</p>

<p>“<i>Water Street.</i>&mdash;Anne Young. She is dead,
and her grandchild enjoys the house, whose father,
by name Baly March, is a notorious knave, and her
husband, one Rob Prenton, as bad, etc.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baly Owen. She hath besides this house<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303"></a>{303}</span>
two houses more, one in Chapel Street and the other
in Moore Street. You must never expect anything
to the value of a farthing from her, but what is for
her own ends.</p>

<p>“<i>Castle Street.</i>&mdash;Mr. William Bushell. Remember
the west end of the back side belonging to this
house in the Castle Street reaches to the Fenwick
Street near the bridge, upon which Mr. Bushell is to
build a good house of stone, answering to the length
for height and other things, as doors, boarded floors,
windows, and slates, sample to his own house near
the post and chains, wherein now Captain Nixon
doth dwell.</p>

<p>“<i>Pool Lane.</i>&mdash;Buy if possible Baly Blundell’s,
and the field betwixt it and the More Street. If you
have it you might pull down your house Mr. Allcocke
built me on the Castle Hill, and there have a brave
coming of the street end out toward the castle, and
you might pull down the west end of Thomas Norbury’s
in the More Street, and so make a most convenient
passage to More Street. This field is most
convenient to you of any man in England, in regard
of your land lying about as it doth.”</p>

<p>He further advises his son and heir to keep
“Castle Street field” locked up, as it is only “a
passage on sufferance;” and he says he was “at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304"></a>{304}</span>
great charge of setting posts and ribbing them all
over with iron, and fixing these two great iron chains,
the which I usually on all occasions keep locked,”
etc. The cause of this, he says, was that Captain
Fazakerly of the Castle had many hundred loads of
coals brought that way, and he was resolved to prevent
his making it a highway; and he very candidly
adds&mdash;“Have in mind likewise that these chains and
posts usually upon Sundays and holidays, and rain
weather; <i>keeping them locked</i> reserves the right in
those streets solely and entire to you and your heirs,
so that a hundred years hence, if you please, you may
make gates, or what other use you please, as usually
you do your own enclosed land, and to hinder all but
whom you please from going thereaways. The
reason I am so strict is two, the first that carts may
not always break the streets to the great charge of
my tenants, but those that carts, make them pay
yearly towards paving them, as many places in
England doth, nay this very town of Leverpole, by a
late order, makes all country carts pay twopence a
load towards paving the streets, and if they can
make such an order of the king’s highway, I hope I
may either make such carts who come thereaway
pay, or make them go some other way.” Sir Edward
then tells his heir that he must be very particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305"></a>{305}</span>
in dealing with his streets in all transactions
with the town of Liverpool. The thoroughfares are
his, he says, yet he sadly remarks that all the streets
but his are “paved out of the town’s box.” Perhaps
Sir Edward was not quite so affable as he might
have been, and hardly of such a conciliatory nature
as even his own interests would have suggested.
Little love seems to have been lost between him and
the townspeople, and there is at least no uncertainty
in the way he apprises his son of this circumstance.
“I find, in whatsoever lies within the town’s liberty,
they are a thousand times more strict than any
gentleman; and forthwith a jury of hot fellows fines
you daily and hourly, either for some encroachment,
the streets being dirty or not paved, and a hundred
odd simple things more than I can relate here. But
keeping your own interest as before expressed, you
need not fear their fines or amercements. There is
no favour or civility to be had from a multitude.
Let my sad experience forewarn you never to trust
them, for if you do, I dare pawn my life they deceive
you. Read Alderman Andow’s character, and some
others I have set down, and then seriously consider it.”</p>

<p>The tenures on which property was built and
held are curiously set forth in these strange directions.
The term “setting” a house, which continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306"></a>{306}</span>
occurs in the Moore rental, is quite in
common use in the northern parts of England, where
indeed it is more frequent than “letting” a house.</p>

<p>Much discussion must often have followed the
amount of fine which a tenant had to pay when the
three lives and twenty-one years his property was
held on had expired, and on this point Sir Edward
Moore is always lucid. Even where, as in few
cases, he had a good word for the tenant, he never
forgets the fine, as:&mdash;“William Gardiner, bailiff, a
very honest man. He paid no rent, only built the
house; it is a very good house. Let the old rent be
raised to 40 shillings per annum, and the fine to £60.”</p>

<p>Again: “Thomas Wainwright, a very honest
man. He paid no fine, only built his house. Let
the old rent be raised to two pounds and fifty pounds
fine at the least.”</p>

<p>In the case of John Pemberton, which is interesting
as showing the terms on which property was
often built along a street, Sir Edward is hardly in
reason. It seems one John Pemberton had commenced
the building of one side of a street, with a
common but tacit understanding that all houses were
to be carried up to the same height as his own, and
as his house was at the upper end of More Street,
the sagacious landlord saw at once that the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307"></a>{307}</span>
on the lower part of the street would be six storeys
high, and when these fell out of lease, the amount of
fine for renewal might fairly be left to him. Two
storeys was all that Pemberton required, and he refused
to build higher. But Sir Edward tells his
own tale best. “John Pemberton, the apothecary, a
base ill-contrived fellow. This man wronged this
street five hundred pounds, for he being the first
house on this side going up, all the rest of the street
engaged to build uniform with him, so that had he
built four stories, all the street had been so, and the
houses toward the lower end of the street had been
six stories high to have made them level with his
of four stories, in regard of the fall of the ground.
I used all the civil means possible to get him to
build higher, and when I saw he would not, I
sent Alderman Andow and the town-clerk, Mr.
John Winstanley, to let him know that as we had
always been friends, I desired the same continuance,
and if he would not build it two stories higher, I
would, all of my own cost and charge.” He seems,
however, to have had at times some kind of slight
fellow-feeling. Thus, in speaking of Mr. John Owen,
bailiff, he says among other directions, that he is
under rented, and he tells his son to see to it, that
there must be a fine of £30. His consideration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308"></a>{308}</span>
the family of Robert Johnson is something touching.
As far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, he dismisses
him with a character readily, and says he is “an
arrant knave, one that grinds from my mill very often;
trust him not, make him pay one pound a year rent,
and ten pounds fine, for he is but a poor knave, and
mercy must be had on his children; only, for being
such a knave make him to slate his house, as all the
street is besides himself.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward takes great pride in his well that he
has dug in More Street, which he gravely tells his
son brews as much ale out of four measures of malt
as any other out of five measures, and there is no
well like it for boiling pease and bearing soap.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Rose, now married to one Diggler, a
glazier,” seems with her husband to have been very
much in Sir Edward’s black books. They were “extreme
unthankful to me, and abused me much
behind my back, therefore never let him glaze for
you, and if ever he have occasion to use you, deal
with him accordingly.... I got him much custom,
and she out of my own good will I paid six pounds
for a gable end, when she had neither money nor
credit to have built it, and ill words is all I got for
my pains. But God reward them. Make them pay
thirty shillings rent, and thirty pounds fine at least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_309" id="page_309"></a>{309}</span>
Hens, two.” And so he runs through the roll of his
tenantry, till one is startled to find one Thomas
Narbury, “a very honest man, and built a good
house; and is so well pleased with his landlord that
he intends to lay out £250 more under me in building.”
Richard Bushell also, and his wife, are “very
honest people; use them well. Make the old rent
40s. a year, and whereas it deserves a hundred
pounds fine, bate them fifty pounds for their honesty
to their landlord.” Of Robert Woodside also he
says, “he is a good honest man, of a Scot;” but
relapses at once into more accustomed phraseology
when speaking of his wife, who is, he says, “as
ungratefull a beast as
is in England.” It
would be interesting
to hear the accounts
the tenantry gave of
their landlord, but
such have not been
preserved.</p>

<p>Bank Hall at Warrington,
was built
shortly after this
summary was sent to Sir Edward’s heir. It is

<p class="nind">is now turned into public offices. The gardens and
grounds are still intact, but smoky tall chimneys
envelope them on every side, and it is probably in
the transition state. Indeed, before very long a
street will pass its noble entrance, and people will
remember that “it once stood in its own grounds,
and the street you are walking in was a geranium
bed thirty years ago.” Murray in his guide-book
speaks of Lancashire as a county abounding in
ancient black-and-white houses, and places it at the
head of all others.
Cheshire, however,
must have many
more, and of course,
as far as the towns
are concerned, there
can be no comparison
in antique relics.
There are in Lancashire
now twelve
boroughs, with mayors
and corporations,
and though
Lancaster is rather picturesque, it may be fairly said
that the character of these corporate towns is
dreariness. We look in vain for some pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_311" id="page_311"></a>{311}</span></p>

<p class="nind">street scene. Chimneys and smoke are the characteristics
of all. Round Manchester there used to be,
and perhaps are yet, some few homesteads of interest,
but the majority of them are swept away. Speke
Hall, near Liverpool, is quite an exceptionally fine
building, but though it was for long a farm-house,
and cattle were in rooms that adorn Nash’s <i>Mansions</i>,
it is now again made into a residence. There
is an old black-and-white house at Kenyon, formerly
the residence of the Lord Chief-Justice Kenyon, but
now empty; and perhaps, excepting another at Newton<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_312" id="page_312"></a>{312}</span>
Junction, that must be familiar to all travellers
between Manchester and Liverpool, there is nothing
that can be regarded as very interesting.</p>

<p>The Isle of Man stands so near Lancashire that
it is often called a part of it, though indeed it is under
a rule different from the rest of England, and does
not return a member to Parliament, which of course,
gives it the privilege of ruling its own finances.
It has a Parliament of its own, and on the 5th of
July, the acts they have passed are publicly read out
on Tynwald Hill, about three miles to the east of Peel.</p>

<p>Castleton is the seat of the governor of this singular
island, and derives its name from an old fortress
called Castle Rushen, which stands in the middle of
the town, and is said, though with uncertain accuracy,
to have been built by a Danish chief in the tenth
century. Peel is a small seaport, and formerly was
of much more importance than it now is. On a sort
of small rocky island here is situated the celebrated
Peel Castle that Scott has alluded to in his novel of
“Peveril of the Peak,” a novel which has been of
some little service in the present work, from the exceeding
care and accuracy of its topographical detail.</p>

<p>In concluding the present series of sketches of
our ancient cities and homesteads, one is met by the
question&mdash;Is it not possible in future buildings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_313" id="page_313"></a>{313}</span>
adopt more of the old spirit, and relieve our streets
from monotony? In reply to which it may readily be
answered, that it is not only possible, but it would
add greatly to the convenience and mercantile value
of a street if such a course were adopted.</p>

<p>The dreary rows of square-headed windows at
even distances in long brick walls govern the rooms
inside, and imperatively domineer over the convenience
of the arrangement. A French writer,
speaking of the palace of Versailles, at the time it was
built, and regretting that a style had been adopted
which demanded this precisely even fenestration,
said that it caused a footman’s pantry to be lit by a
huge window which had perforce to correspond with
a row in a drawing-room on the same front, and perhaps
had to be cut in two by a partition, to let the
other half do duty for another minor apartment.</p>

<p>On the ground of economy and fitness alone
our humbler streets call aloud for improvement; and
if it is said that England is now a nation of shopkeepers,
it must be remembered that Venice was
too, and that in the days of its greatest architectural
grandeur.</p>

<p>Indeed, when she began to decay, her arts
declined too. Mr. Beresford Hope, in some admirable
remarks delivered at the Town Hall, Hanley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_314" id="page_314"></a>{314}</span>
said “he wished to show them that the world’s
debt to art was one in which they all had a share.
It was a joint-stock company, in which every man,
woman, and child, had a share, which he or she might
pay up with a perfect certainty of ample return.
By art he meant the science of beauty in material
things,&mdash;that art which was something for the artist
and something for the people themselves&mdash;which
stood in no need of being separated from the everyday
wear and bustle of common life&mdash;which had to
do with buying and selling, with marrying and
giving in marriage, with lying down and getting
up, with buying in the cheapest and selling in the
dearest market, with all the wear and tear of everyday
life,&mdash;instead of being something separate from
this. Art is beauty, but it is also economy and
appropriateness. Art is the faculty of being able
with the greatest economy of material, of colour, and
invention, to be able to produce the brightest effects.”</p>

<p>“In Kent,” he further on says, “there is a traditionary
way of building chimneys, by a simple
variation in the management of common bricks, but
the effects produced are most picturesque; any
common labourer could do it, but it is true art.”
Mr. Hope then takes a row of houses in Birmingham,
or Manchester, or Bradford. They were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315"></a>{315}</span>
many houses put up&mdash;no outline or skyline,&mdash;“The
same dread, dreary, uniform, colourless square block,
the same square doors, brass knockers and door
plates, the same sash windows, the same stone slab
under the windows, the same chimneys, and when
they went inside, the same rhubarb-coloured oilcloth
on the passage, the same rooms with the
same paper on the walls, and the same chimney-piece.”
This is truly and well said. It is almost
impossible to feel otherwise than weary and dull on
the brightest summer’s day in Liverpool. Architectural
dreariness is carried to the highest pitch of
which it is capable in this town, though some parts
of Birkenhead rival it. Now, as has been already
remarked, Chester is not only a delightful city to
walk in, a city which it is a pleasure to have any
business to transact in, but its arrangement and the
unstudied variety of its houses make it serviceable
and economical. The shifting, broken skyline, and
the gables of the houses projecting as it were in
amicable rivalry into the street, are always pleasant
and cheerful to behold. If it is asked whether such
a style of building would seriously be recommended
in a practical point of view, I would say again and
again it should. The Chester architects have quite
adopted the indigenous style, and, to do them justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316"></a>{316}</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/i_316_lg.jpg">

<br />
<span class="caption">HIGHAM FERRARS, NORTHANTS.</span>
</div>

<p class="nind">they have adapted it too. There is no lack of convenience
in their recent erections. The buildings
which have an exterior made to fit them are quite
as likely to be convenient and serviceable as those
which are made to fit a dreary square exterior; and as
for utility and popular appreciation, a test is ready.
Build one street in the square style Mr. Hope has
so graphically described, and another in picturesque
outline, and see which brings in the best return
for the money, supposing of course all other things
are equal, such as site and accommodation; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_317" id="page_317"></a>{317}</span>
pleasant architectural appearance and expression of
the one street will always leave the other in the
distance.</p>

<p>And this word “expression” is a very significant
one, and a useful one too. The parts of a building
may not be individually beautiful, and yet there may
be a good “expression” in it. The details of Charles
I.’s style are often grotesquely bad when viewed in
piecemeal, and yet we recognise a good expression
in the building of that period as we enter some old
town. Early English foliage is extremely stiff, and
taken by itself ludicrous, as far as any imitation of
nature, which it is supposed to be intended to represent,
is concerned; and yet who can be insensible to
the general result? The capitals throw a fine shade
on the turrets in the sunshine when there are angular
shafts, and the tall slender columns (clustered perhaps),
though they may have no feature that can
be singled out as excellent, are very fine in general
effect. Expression may therefore exist independently
of detail, as beautiful detail may be lavished over a
façade, and lost. To bring the comparison, as has
been done, to the human countenance, a building
may be</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dead perfection, no more;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_318" id="page_318"></a>{318}</span></p>

<p class="nind">and yet another may be pleasant, and bright without
such advantages as these. We have often seen, to
continue the simile of a human countenance, a face
that has nothing regular or perfect about it, yet the
features seemed in harmony, and there was a
pleasant expression. Of course nothing here can
apply to the grotesque designs in bosses and
gurgoyles that so often appear in our buildings after
the thirteenth century; they are inexpressibly tedious
and useless, and never under any circumstances
have they the slightest relevance or interest. They
may be sometimes of trifling local curiosity, as
illustrating some scandal or abuse that was in vogue
at the time of their cutting, but even at that they
are very dreary and out of place. Of course any
one who tries to imitate them now in an ecclesiastical
building is quite out of court, and the only
excuse he can plead is that he has not skill to
design anything better.</p>

<p>Expression in buildings cannot always be carried
out to the extent of showing from their external appearance
what they are, though some indication is
possible under any circumstances. A general fitness
may be shown, and that is enough. There is a
costly bank in Montreal, where in a moment of
inspiration the architect has conceived the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_319" id="page_319"></a>{319}</span>
overturning cornucopias and allowing sovereigns of
stone to appear as though they were falling into the
street. If this is at all typical of the mode in which
the business is conducted, a change of managers
would be a rather palpable advantage to the shareholders.
There is a bank at Altringham, built for
Messrs. Cunliffe, Brooks, and Co., in the “post and
petrel style” so common in Cheshire, and although
there is no such demonstrative ornament about it as
this, it is clearly a public building of some importance,
and is certainly one of the best specimens of
revival that have ever been produced in England.</p>

<p>Vitruvius specifies seven qualities on which the
Greeks insisted&mdash;solidity, convenience, order, disposition,
proportion, decorum, economy; but Barry
is able to reduce these to three&mdash;permanence, convenience,
and beauty, as he stated in a very
interesting lecture to the Royal Academy; and it
is not too much to say that the requirements of
Vitruvius will be found to arrange themselves under
these three heads.</p>

<p>Now, the typical architecture of the day, for
example the Crystal Palace, can scarcely be called
permanent. It may and probably will last for
generations with very ordinary care, but “its root
is ever in its grave.” Of course permanence is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_320" id="page_320"></a>{320}</span>
a part of architecture. Dock gates or granite entrances
to warehouses may easily possess all that, and
show it too, but yet be sadly deficient in other
qualities necessary for successful architecture. In
engineering buildings there must be a nice calculation
of strength. The materials, such as iron rods, and
nuts, and screws, are costly, and if increased beyond
necessity do not add to the strength of the fabric.
A light iron truss spanning fifty feet might be able
to bear enormous weights, while an iron scantling
containing four times the amount of metal would
break from its own weight; but in stone buildings
there is no such reserve. The engineer who constructs
a roof or shed too strongly, or he whose building
is wanting in strength, are both deficient in skill.
Stone, however, needs no such caution. It may be
used so as to possess, and appear to possess, a
surplussage of strength, and yet not seem excessive,
and the same may fairly be claimed for brick and
oak. The ends of beams that show their massive
proportions to the street, and support an overhanging
storey of some black-and-white building, proclaim
their strength and sufficiency, and cannot appear
excessive or overdone, from the nature of their
material, which is so plentiful. Convenience more
particularly applies to the interior of a building, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_321" id="page_321"></a>{321}</span>
refers to the arrangement and size of the rooms. A
properly proportioned room should neither be too
low nor too high, though sometimes the latter is overlooked;
especially in modern terrace houses, where
a well-like appearance is given to a room of ordinary
dimensions by too great height. Singularly enough,
however, it is a fact that a well-contrived house may
always be said to afford greater facilities for a good
exterior than an ill-contrived one; the fitness inside
shows itself in the exterior. And as to beauty, it is
hard indeed if, when the building is successful in
these two other requirements, the third does not
follow. The same exterior may of course be ornamented
in many ways, and may have either a
Gothic or classic coat, or be left alone; but when
once the necessary outline is secured decoration is
simple. One great charm of old houses is that they
do not conceal either their roofs or chimneys.
Modern ones are apt to be shy of letting them
appear, and contrive by parapets and other devices
to hide them.</p>

<p>A staircase at the end of this chapter illustrates
the comfortable easy landings and flights that
characterise old house architecture, even when on
an unpretending scale. The date is about 1600,
and the comfort of ascent is far beyond any staircases<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_322" id="page_322"></a>{322}</span>
that we should expect to find in a moderately-sized
house in the present day.</p>

<p>An architect of some eminence, in reading a
paper on Gloucester Cathedral, said (a few years
ago), “I raise my voice against what I consider
cankers in modern architecture, where art is so far
forgotten in the desire of the architect to obtain for
his works a so-called individuality. This individuality
is enticing to very young men, who are attracted
by the eccentricities of old buildings, or the architect
who imports them, for nearly all modern individuality
arises from too strongly emphasising and
repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> some odd bit picked up in
foreign travel. It so happens that many architects
have no faith in good sound building, they have no
trust in the grandeur of stability, they have no love
for simplicity, no appreciation for breadth of treatment:
they go in for quaintness.” So far as this is
intelligible, it means to say that a broad row of
houses without individuality is preferable to one
where the individual tastes and requirements of the
owner are conspicuous. The same writer proceeds
to object to the early capitals that distinguish the
Gothic of the twelfth century when clustered round
a column, and, as he says, “wrap it round a shaft
nearly as big as an Irish round tower.” He objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_323" id="page_323"></a>{323}</span>
also to the “dog-tooth” and the undercut capitals
that often appear in such profusion in France, and
which he compares to “exaggerated sticks of rhubarb,”
and warns his junior hearers against ornamenting
spires with crockets like Salisbury, which
he says in that building can only be called a
“positive mania” on the part of the architect, and
he proclaims loudly against the enrichments in
Hereford and Gloucester. Regarding the latter, he
says that a contemporaneous monk grumbled at the
expense, and recorded his objections in some record
that remains. Whether the monk who regretted
the waste was the one that carried the bag or not
seems not to be very clear; but in a word, the
criticisms are quite unjust. And as for Salisbury,
though some may consider that the spire is too thin,
there can be no exception taken to its beautiful
enrichments. The monk who is quoted with
approval seems to have said that as much was spent
in ornamenting the church as would have built
another. Quite so; indeed the cost of any cathedral
would build not one more but many, quite a colony
of meeting-houses with 9-inch brick walls. “The
basest beggars,” says Lear, “are in the poorest thing
superfluous.” This paper is by a well-known
architect, and was published some few years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_324" id="page_324"></a>{324}</span>
in the <i>Building News</i>, or else it would not be
noticed.</p>

<p>The question continually must recur, what means
the designers of old used to secure such almost
universally satisfactory effects. It is clear that in
many instances they worked from drawings. These
are in some cases extant, but they must also have
had many opportunities of testing the effect of
their work from various points of view, and altering
and amending as they proceeded. Many a carefully
studied design that looks perfect on paper is a sad
disappointment when executed. The chimney that
stood so boldly forward is choked in the perspective
as we look up. Perhaps, indeed, it disappears
entirely from the view, and the gables have a more
apoplectic appearance than we had fondly hoped, and
little by little the day-dreams of the architect vanish.</p>

<p>The designers of old seemed to be free from
such vexations, for though it would be saying too
much to pretend that they never made mistakes, or
that all they did is excellent, we must freely admit
that our productions are less satisfactory than theirs.</p>

<p>It is by no means, however, a very easy task
to point out wherein the secret of the difference
lies, nor to say why old builders almost universally
were guided to forms of beauty. Long and energetically<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_325" id="page_325"></a>{325}</span>
the question was debated of whether some
ancient code of rules that once regulated their
operations has been lost,&mdash;recipes, as it were, to
trust themselves to when they went to their work,&mdash;and
indeed, some twenty years ago, a chapter in
the <i>Archæological Journal</i> gave precise directions
for the proportions of a pinnacle, found, as it was
said, in some old monastic archives; but both
sides were agreed that when worked out it was
exceedingly shapeless and ugly. Every probability
points in the other direction. The versatility of
design, the adaptation to site, and the way in which
a necessity of construction is often converted into
a beauty, indicate individual taste and ingenuity.
Again, there was no distinction between the office
of architect and builder, as the following extract
from an old agreement for building a chapel to
St. Mary’s Church, Chester, illustrates:&mdash;“This
indenture, made by twene William Troutbeck
Esquire, on that p’tie, and Thomas Betes, mason,
on that other p’tie, bares witnesse that the aforesaid
Thomas has made covenant and granted to the
said William that he shall make a chapell in the
chirche yarde of Ste. Marie on the Hill, on the
south side of the Chancell of the said Chirche
there, that is to wete, the est ende, the south side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_326" id="page_326"></a>{326}</span>
and the west ende, contayning the lengthe of the
chauncell there, and xviii. fete wide withinne the
walls, and as high as hit nedes resonably to be:
with v. faire and clenely wroght windows full of
light, that is to say, one gable window at the est
ende with iiij. lights, iij. windowes on the south
side, ich one of iij. lights, and on the west ende
in the best way to be deviset; and iiij. botras
on the south side, with a grete arche in the west
ende; and the chapelle to be battlet above like to
the little closet withinne the Castell of Chester,
with a corbyl table longyng thereto; and at ayther
end iij. honest fynials. And the said William
shall pay the said Thomas xxli. like as the worke
goes forwarde, and also give him a gowne. And
also the said William shall find fre-stone, lyme, sond,
wat<sup>r</sup>, windelasse, and stuff for to scaffold with, and
such manere necessaries as the foresaid Thomas
nedes; and the foresaid Thomas shall, by ov’sight
of Maester John Asser, make the chapell and all
things that longen thereto (masoncraft) honestly.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>There is almost a touching simplicity and confidence
about this contract. All about the walls,
with reference to the height they were to be carried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_327" id="page_327"></a>{327}</span>
is that they must be as high as it “nedes resonably
to be;” and the windows are not apparently
to be encumbered with more tracery than the mason
cares to give,&mdash;the “v.” of them were to be “faire
and clenely wroght.” What a hopeless task an
architect, or clerk of the works, as “Maester John
Asser” seems to have been, would now have with
such a specification in settling up a builder’s “extra
account”! Yet it nowhere appears that the work
was slighted. On the contrary, though this chapel
is no more, there is abundant evidence that it was
a noble piece of work. The contract is introduced
here to show how completely the present state of
things differs from that of the fifteenth century,
when the chapel in question was built. Not that
it would be possible or desirable in the nineteenth
century to bring back such agreements; but it is
evident from the specification that the artificers
were a very superior set of men to those who now
erect our buildings. The beautiful crockets and
bosses that ornament ancient cathedrals were cut
as the work proceeded by the mason whose place
on the building they happened to fall to, and
though they are now models of excellence, the
great probability is they were cut without drawings
to guide the workmen. One inestimable advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_328" id="page_328"></a>{328}</span>
in the kind of contract quoted is that, when such
men as it may be supposed Betes and Asser were,
were concerned, the “resonableness” of the height
of the chancel or the “fairness” of the tracery
could be judged of as the building proceeded.
The picturesqueness of the sky-line, or
the relative proportions of any part to the surroundings
could be determined while the building
progressed. Nor does this require a great amount
of natural talent. If beauty in architecture had
been encouraged during the last two centuries,
instead of being frowned down, we should still
have the class of men who were competent. Of
course, as before remarked, it would be impossible,
in the present nature of things, to re-introduce such
a style of contract as that quoted; but one thing
we can do,&mdash;we can try to arrive at some of the
principles of design that influenced the old workmen.
There is no code of rules, and to try to
design with their pencils will be to many architects
of the present day as hopeless a task as to
write with Shakespeare’s pen; but if, beyond all
other considerations, whether for town or country,
the grand principle of picturesqueness is kept in
view, the end will be surely gained. By picturesqueness
is meant the contrasting of various simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_329" id="page_329"></a>{329}</span>
forms in such a way as to be pleasing to the eye.
It runs through all our intellectual life in every
thing we do. A barrister may be ever so learned
and industrious, and even in earnest, but if he lacks
an appreciation of the picturesque he will fight at
great odds with another who, with less application
and perhaps a worse case, can arrange his facts&mdash;sometimes,
alas! even his theories&mdash;in a pleasing
form. This is well understood and successfully cultivated
at the Bar, but in the Church it is sadly
wanting, and so the most learned addresses from
the pulpit are too often bald.</p>

<p>In another essay read by the architect whose
paper was quoted from, an essay also which
appeared in the <i>Building News</i> of the same year,
that gentleman describes the picturesque as “anything
which may be likened to a ‘pig with one ear’&mdash;an
ancient similitude much admired by the
scientific, and often used by them with great force
and brilliancy. It is unfortunate, but none the less
true, that a very large majority of those who follow
after Gothic art, both as students and admirers, have
somehow or other been led into the belief that the
first principle, the essence of the soul of Gothic, is
irregularity. These are the men who stick chimneys
in odd corners where they are sure to smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_330" id="page_330"></a>{330}</span>
put dormers on roofs where they are not wanted,
throw out large oriels to small bath-rooms, and
corbel out balconies to housemaids’ closets.” This
is a heavy calendar indeed against the “very large
majority” of the profession, but I rejoice to think it
is not just. Nearly every one now understands that
picturesqueness has nothing to do with irregularity,
<i>i.e.</i> irregularity for itself; and as for an architect who
could throw out a large oriel to a small bath-room,
unless the proprietor spent a long time there, and
especially ordered it, his occupation would soon go.
So far from having an impression that picturesqueness
and irregularity are synonymous, most architects
admit the necessity of repose in their works.
Take the nave of a Gothic church, with its row of
windows; nobody now would say that it gained by
having each window different. In the best examples
regularity of form is observed; it is in such
feeble late works as Merton College Chapel that
the reverse prevails. In great Gothic buildings,
especially on the Continent, the whole mass seems
one mountain of confusion, and it is only when we
examine it minutely, and carry down each feature
to its starting-point, that we find the order which
prevails. Just as in a peal of bells from a church-tower,
the first impression they are apt to convey is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_331" id="page_331"></a>{331}</span>
that each ringer is pulling away promiscuously, the
only condition being that they shall manage to pull
only a single bell at a time; but they are, on the
contrary, following a perfectly regular scale, contrived
with profound order and symmetry.</p>

<p>Of course, unless an architect is also partly an
artist he cannot be successful; no amount of learning
can compensate for this. The two best expositors
we ever had of Gothic architecture, Rickman and
Britton, were indifferent architects. Perhaps they
may be said to have known more than all who went
before them or followed after; and both of them
were endowed with a thorough love for their
profession. There may be something to urge that
they were not brought up to it, one being in a
mercantile office in Liverpool, and the other a wine-bottler
in London. Rickman had a number of
opportunities of testing his architectural skill, but
they are all dreary, and showed that his hand could
not put into practice the principles of the architecture
he understood and loved so well. Britton
had fewer chances, and was even less successful
with his few.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might be well to try to answer the
question, “What would be the best way to improve
the architecture of the most dreary of all classes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_332" id="page_332"></a>{332}</span>
buildings, the humbler houses of the middle classes,
the houses that are let for about £40 or £50 per
annum?” and the best way to answer it is to suppose
a case in which the conditions would be the most
favourable. Suppose, for example, there were to be
a number of gentlemen who were each prepared to
spend £800 in a row of houses for their own
residences. Well, let them all agree upon an artistic
architect, and let them each arrange their own plans
to suit their own convenience. This would give the
architect not only data, but ideas to work upon.
Well, let him then take all these plans, and fit to
them an elevation which shall be as broad and
uniform as the convenience admits. There will still
be plenty of variety, the various requirements of the
builders will secure that, or enable the architect to
employ it. The Vicar’s Close at Wells, or the
collegiate buildings in Oxford or Ely, would afford
any number of examples of what he required. In
one of the excellent Manuals published for the use
of amateur artists by Winsor and Newton, the
author has divided his subject into Atmosphere,
Keeping, Contrast, and Variety, which, if rightly
understood, is only another way of expressing the
requirements of Barry in the former part of this
chapter. A quotation from this Manual, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_333" id="page_333"></a>{333}</span>
relates to sketching in colour, may be as useful to
an architect as to an artist. “First learn how to
produce certain effects, and you will not then find it
difficult to store them in your memory for use as
you require them; you are learning nothing new in
the art of painting&mdash;thousands have gone through
this process before you; you are only seeking to
chronicle your own experience. The scenes you
commit to paper have, and will have, a peculiar
charm for you, and perhaps to your friends if you
represent them faithfully. They may be new
scenes, but they are not seen under new <i>effects</i>.
These have been already witnessed again and again;
you yourself have seen the same effect produced in
former pictures; but the charm lies in producing
them yourself from nature. Aim then at facility in
producing these effects in general, and you will
easily apply and vary that knowledge as you require
it. Aim at acquiring a kind of <i>grammar of effect</i>,
just as in reading music, the habitué recognises a
certain set of notes from their frequent recurrence,
and which is even called by musical people a <i>phrase</i>,
alluding to the similar recurrence of words in the
composition of a sentence. It is knowledge that
leads to decision, which is the secret of rapidity.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_334" id="page_334"></a>{334}</span>
Of course, with an architect rapidity is not necessary,
it only pertains to a sketcher in water-colours, whose
materials dry up rapidly. A hundred lessons in
architecture may be gained every time that we walk
along a pleasant lane, and the village with a
cheerful row of cottages grown over with creepers,
and showing tall chimneys, is full of suggestions in
light and shade and composition. In all importations
of foreign architecture&mdash;and it is not pretended
that there should be none&mdash;the first thing to consider
is its fitness for the climate and surroundings. Dol,
Morlaix, and other towns in the north of France,
contain many suggestions for city architecture.
Our own cathedrals and great churches were meant
to stand alone, and can only be seen at some
distance; the churches on the Continent were often
designed for the effect they would have in a
crowded town; but here again, the old chronic error
has to be met, that Gothic buildings suit country scenes
the best, and Classic a town, whereas the only place
where a classic building can be employed, except by
a man of absolute genius, is in the country among
heavy foliage.</p>

<p>There is nothing so bald or unsatisfactory as a
Grecian building, such as has been erected in
England since the so-called “revival” of Classic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_335" id="page_335"></a>{335}</span>
architecture. The cold Doric façades, or Ionic as
the case may be, give one a sensation of intense
dreariness. The stuccoed front of a conventicle
strictly copied from the Parthenon, or more
probably from the Gate of the Agora, is a thing to
wonder at; and too often we form our ideas of
Grecian art from modern revivals. Surely we might
have expected that the principal seat of classic
learning in England might boast of a proper Greek
building, if the Professor of Architecture to the
Royal Academy, who had made Greek design the
study of his life, were employed; but no one can
contemplate the Taylor and Randolph Institution at
Oxford without feeling humiliated at the idea that it
was erected under such circumstances. The Acropolis
at Athens is an abrupt hill with a flat surface of
perhaps ten acres on the top. The Eastern aspect
rises in a kind of bluff, and is crowned by the
Parthenon and the Propylæa. The Parthenon was
an oblong temple surrounded by forty-six vast
marble columns. These seen from below give at
once the idea of lightness and strength, and it exhibits
in the most perfect form the “entasis” or
swelling that a cylinder requires; this alone would
show the true eye for form of the ancient Greek
architect. The Erechtheum is a vast building on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_336" id="page_336"></a>{336}</span>
northern side of the Acropolis; and, according to
Pausanias, the table-land of the Acropolis was
absolutely crowded with works of art; indeed at the
present time there are remains at every stride.
Lamartine, in his <i>Voyage en Orient</i>, gives a vivid
description of the impression the ruins of Athens
made upon him, and concludes his rhapsody with
reflections, of which the following is a translation:&mdash;“When
again shall we find such a people and such
an epoch? Nothing announces their coming. The
Propylæa and the Temple of Erechtheus, or of the
Caryatides, stand at the side of the Parthenon&mdash;masterpieces
in themselves, but lost in the proximity
of a grander masterpiece. The soul, overpowered
by the sight of the latter, has no longer any power
to admire the others&mdash;one must gaze and then
depart!&mdash;lamenting not so much the devastation
of this glorious handiwork of man, as the impossibility
that man should ever equal its sublimity and
harmony.” Chateaubriand eulogises Athens in a
similar strain, and neither of them say one word too
much perhaps; but let us fairly ask ourselves what
we admire so in the classic architecture of Greece. I
would say without hesitation that we fail to see the
real excellence but too often. A Greek temple
transported into England, yes the Parthenon itself, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_337" id="page_337"></a>{337}</span>
barbarous and hideous. We pass it by as we would
Demosthenes on a doorstep inveighing against
Philip, relieved to be out of the way. There is no
mysterious beauty in a column six or eight diameters
high&mdash;a ruler is often of the same proportions, and
we do not become enthusiastic over it; yet, so much
are we influenced by prejudice, that the rude colouring
of the Greek temples which the Turks plastered
over the buildings they occupied during the seventeenth
century, is supposed to be correct taste.
Even yet it is commonly, very commonly, believed,
that the colouring belongs to the Greek period, and
the plaints of even so great an authority as Stuart
are touching. I was astonished to find in his
preface to the careful volume on Athens, the following:&mdash;“Yet
there is one circumstance of comparatively
recent discovery, and still more recently
ascertained to its full extent, which gives a strange
contradiction to our cherished notions concerning
the purity of Grecian taste, and its antipathy to all
coarseness and exaggeration. It should seem that
the Greeks painted their temples, not merely in
chiaroscuro, or in subdued tints, for the purpose of
giving relief to projections or expressiveness to
ornamental details, but with glaring colours,&mdash;reds,
blues, and yellows, with violent contrasts; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_338" id="page_338"></a>{338}</span>
columns one hue, and the entablature another.
Nay,” he says, “there is shrewd suspicion that the
sculptures were painted like the figure-head of a
man-of-war, and that the pillars were striped, and
unluckily the evidences of these incredibilities is most
exasperatingly clear; the statements of the German
architects employed by King Otho leave no doubt
whatever,” etc. etc.; and I once saw a devout student
of Greek art poring over one of those revived temples&mdash;the
columns and entablature a bright coffee colour,
and the triglyphs blue&mdash;trying to admire it; he
humbly thought he must be wrong, and the Greeks
must be right.’ Why, the Turks did all this during
their possession. The colours here indicated would
be about the Turkman’s idea of correct taste,
savouring of the bazaar and booth. They trailed
their cannon up the Propylæa, and broke down the
carved work thereof with axes and hammers, and
soon they set up their banners for tokens. Mnesthenes
never coloured the Erechtheum, or Pausanias
would have said so in the account of his ramble over
it; and Phidias and Praxiteles may fairly be left
alone&mdash;<i>they</i> never daubed the Parthenon with ochre.
The architecture of the Acropolis, great as it is in
its own merits, requires a Greek eye and Greek
modes of thought to understand thoroughly and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_339" id="page_339"></a>{339}</span>
appreciate. Its great and grand idea is calm and
dignified repose. It is the repose of the Sphynx or
an Egyptian pyramid refined into beauty; and among
the rocks of Attica, which are rugged and rough,
a Gothic building, such as Strasbourg or Cologne,
would be out of place; the crockets and pinnacles
would be dwarfed by the igneous rocks that are about,
and the Greek well knew how a calm flat surface
would harmonise and contrast with the country
round.</p>

<p>Modern discoveries by Michaelis regarding
the statue of Minerva would show that it was of
stupendous dimensions, and covered with ivory and
gold; the light coming from above, and relieving
it from the dark shades of the portico behind.</p>

<p>We have nothing now to compare this with, or
anything indeed to enable us to form a comparison
by. The effect must not only have been striking,
but in the refraction of light in the latitude of
Athens, conditions would exist that differ essentially
from any we could reproduce here.</p>

<p>The architecture of England is essentially its
own, it is capable of adaptation to every known
requirement, and many more.</p>

<p>Leaving fortifications and cathedrals on one side
as exceptional, there is often a great wealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_340" id="page_340"></a>{340}</span>
beauty in the most unpretending domestic buildings,
that would lighten up a street or landscape, and
if imitated would prove attractive to a tenant.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
